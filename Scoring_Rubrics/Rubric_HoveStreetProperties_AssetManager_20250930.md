## Scoring Guidelines
**MANDATORY: Include complete scoring interpretation from framework rubric**

### Overall Score Ranges:
- **90-100**: Exceptional candidate - exceeds requirements significantly across all dimensions with proven track record
- **80-89**: Excellent candidate - strong match with minor gaps if any, ready for immediate contribution
- **70-79**: Good candidate - solid match with some development areas, capable with onboarding support
- **60-69**: Potential candidate - meets core requirements with notable gaps, requires training and development
- **50-59**: Borderline candidate - significant gaps in critical areas, consider only if high potential or unique strengths
- **Below 50**: Not recommended - major gaps in critical areas, insufficient qualifications for role

## Usage Guidelines

### When Scoring:
1. Review job description thoroughly before scoring - focus on "must-haves" vs "nice-to-haves"
2. Map each requirement to candidate's experience with specific evidence from work history
3. Look for evidence, not assumptions - require concrete examples and measurable outcomes
4. Consider recency of experience (weight recent more heavily) - industrial experience from last 5 years valued higher
5. Account for career progression and growth trajectory - upward trajectory indicates capability

### Critical Factors:
- **Minimum 7 years experience**: Any candidate below 7 years total may be disqualified unless exceptional
- **Minimum 2 years industrial exposure**: Direct industrial experience is highly preferred; less than 2 years is significant gap
- **MRI proficiency required**: No MRI experience is notable gap, though Yardi/Argus experience provides transferability
- **Driver's license mandatory**: Must possess valid license for property visits - non-negotiable requirement
- **Construction knowledge essential**: Role requires demonstrated construction/capital project experience - weak area is concern

### Documentation:
- Note specific examples supporting each score with CV line references
- Document concerns or areas needing clarification for interview follow-up
- Identify questions for interview follow-up to validate experience claims
- Record any special circumstances or context affecting scoring

## Role-Specific Considerations

### Market Context (Toronto Industrial Real Estate - 2025)
- **Strong Industrial Market**: GTA industrial vacancy rates <2%, landlord-favorable conditions, significant rent growth 2020-2025
- **Competitive Talent Market**: Experienced industrial asset managers in high demand, limited candidate pool with 7+ years experience
- **Technology Expectations**: MRI dominance in Canadian institutional market, though Yardi and Argus also widely used
- **Relationship-Driven**: Strong brokerage and service provider networks critical for success in Toronto market

### Hove Street Properties Specific Context
- **Private Owner-Operator**: Portfolio primarily managed internally with full-service platform (different from REIT or fund model)
- **17M SF Portfolio**: Significant scale across North America requiring sophisticated asset management capabilities
- **Vertically Integrated**: Related manufacturing/distribution operations provide unique context and internal client dynamics
- **Hands-On Culture**: Not a passive investment management role - requires active engagement and direct involvement
- **Senior Management Role**: Reports to COO, integral member of senior team - requires executive presence and strategic thinking

### Key Success Factors for This Role
1. **Industrial Asset Class Expertise**: Deep understanding of industrial tenant requirements, market dynamics, lease structures
2. **Execution Excellence**: Proven ability to deliver results (occupancy, NOI) through active management vs passive approach
3. **Cross-Functional Leadership**: Success requires collaboration across legal, leasing, construction, accounting, property management
4. **Stakeholder Management**: Balance ownership objectives, tenant needs, broker relationships, internal operations effectively
5. **Hands-On + Strategic**: Must operate tactically (site visits, negotiation details) while thinking strategically (portfolio optimization)

### Red Flags to Watch For
- **Office-Only Background**: Pure office experience without industrial exposure lacks critical tenant/market understanding
- **Passive Investment Focus**: Fund/REIT analyst roles emphasizing financial analysis over operational execution
- **Limited Leasing Experience**: Asset management without direct leasing involvement creates dependency on others
- **No Construction Background**: Capital planning without hands-on construction knowledge limits effectiveness
- **Geographic Mismatch**: International experience without North American context may require market adjustment

### Interview Focus Areas Based on Rubric
1. **Industrial Tenant Requirements**: Probe understanding of clear height, dock doors, parking ratios, truck circulation vs office/retail knowledge
2. **Lease Negotiation Specifics**: Request examples of complex negotiations - TI structures, rent escalations, renewal options, landlord/tenant work
3. **Construction Project Details**: Validate hands-on involvement vs oversight - contractor selection, change orders, budget management
4. **Performance Metrics**: Verify quantitative achievements - exact occupancy improvements, rent growth percentages, NOI increases with timeframes
5. **Technology Proficiency**: Assess MRI gap if present - ability to learn new systems, compare to Yardi/Argus experience depth
6. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Examples of navigating organizational complexity, resolving conflicts, achieving buy-in across departments
7. **Cultural Fit**: Gauge hands-on orientation, comfort with travel, entrepreneurial mindset vs corporate bureaucracy preference
