## Scoring Guidelines
**MANDATORY: Include complete scoring interpretation from framework rubric**

### Overall Score Ranges:
- **90-100**: Exceptional candidate - exceeds requirements significantly across all dimensions; rare combination of institutional real estate expertise, multi-asset class leadership, and university/mission-driven experience; immediate impact potential
- **80-89**: Excellent candidate - strong match with minor gaps if any; deep asset management experience with most required elements; proven leadership and value creation; may need modest onboarding on university culture or specific asset classes
- **70-79**: Good candidate - solid match with some development areas; meets core requirements with adequate experience; demonstrable track record but gaps in preferred areas (student housing, institutional experience, advanced education/certifications)
- **60-69**: Potential candidate - meets minimum requirements with notable gaps; may have strong commercial experience but limited institutional/university exposure; or strong public sector background with limited multi-asset complexity; significant development needed
- **50-59**: Borderline candidate - significant gaps in critical areas; consider only if high potential or unique specialized expertise; major onboarding and development required; may lack senior leadership experience, portfolio scale, or asset class diversity
- **Below 50**: Not recommended - major gaps in critical requirements; lacks institutional real estate experience, senior leadership track record, or multi-asset class expertise; insufficient experience level for executive director role

## Usage Guidelines

### When Scoring:
1. Review job description thoroughly focusing on institutional context, multi-asset class requirements, and university mission alignment
2. Map each requirement to candidate's demonstrated experience with specific evidence from CV
3. Look for evidence, not assumptions - require explicit proof of scale, scope, outcomes, and leadership
4. Consider recency of experience (weight last 5-10 years most heavily; institutional real estate evolves rapidly)
5. Account for career progression and growth trajectory - candidate should show advancement to senior leadership

### Critical Factors:
- **Institutional real estate experience is critical** - commercial-only backgrounds may struggle with academic stakeholder dynamics and mission balance
- **Multi-asset class expertise including multi-residential or student housing is mandatory** - office-only experience insufficient
- **Senior leadership with team management is required** - individual contributors or small team leads will not meet role demands
- **Portfolio scale matters** - candidate should have managed portfolios >C$250M to handle University's C$500M+ scope
- **Stakeholder complexity essential** - must demonstrate navigation of complex governance, JV partnerships, external stakeholders
- Any "must-have" requirement scored below 2 points (Proficient level) creates significant risk
- Consider minimum acceptable scores: Technical Skills ≥10, Experience ≥15, Responsibilities ≥12, Achievements ≥8

### Documentation:
- Note specific CV evidence supporting each score with line number references
- Document concerns or areas needing interview clarification
- Identify questions for interview follow-up (verify portfolio scale, institutional experience depth, stakeholder complexity)
- Record any special circumstances or context affecting scoring (career breaks, geographic differences, industry transitions)
- Flag any potential overscoring based on assumptions vs hard evidence

## Role-Specific Considerations
**MANDATORY: Add specific considerations based on job posting analysis**

### University of Toronto Context:
- **Urban Intensification Environment**: Toronto experiencing rapid growth; finite land holdings face external pressures and opportunities; requires strategic thinking about land value maximization vs mission alignment
- **4Corners Real Estate Strategy**: University's structured approach to real estate partnerships and development; candidate should understand strategic real estate platforms
- **Spaces & Experiences Integration**: Portfolio combines Ancillary Services with Real Estate Partnerships since 2020; requires understanding of both commercial performance and student/community experience
- **Academic Mission Primacy**: Real estate must support long-term academic vision; financial performance secondary to mission but still critical for institutional sustainability
- **Governance Complexity**: Reports to AVP Spaces & Experiences; interfaces with Managing Director Real Estate, VP Operations & Real Estate Partnerships, CFO; requires political acumen and executive presence
- **Team Management Scope**: Director-level reports (Asset Management, Leasing, Ecosystem, Accounting) plus Analysts and Associates; requires senior leadership capability

### Market Conditions & Competitive Landscape:
- **Canadian Institutional Real Estate**: Different regulatory environment from US (residential tenancy, land use, provincial regulations); Canadian experience preferred
- **Student Housing Boom**: Significant institutional investment activity 2023-2024; competitive market for talent with student housing experience
- **Multi-Residential Expertise**: Growing asset class for institutional investors; candidates with Purpose, Minto, Greenwin, Starlight, or REIT multi-residential experience highly valuable
- **Technology Adoption**: Universities increasingly sophisticated in real estate technology; VTS, Yardi, Argus experience differentiating factors

### Assessment Priorities:
1. **Institutional/University Real Estate Experience** (Critical) - Weight heavily; commercial-only candidates high risk
2. **Multi-Asset Class including Multi-Residential/Student Housing** (Critical) - Essential capability gap if missing
3. **Senior Leadership with Complex Stakeholder Management** (Critical) - Cannot develop quickly; must demonstrate
4. **Portfolio Scale & Scope** (Very Important) - C$500M+ experience reduces transition risk significantly
5. **Financial Modeling & Value Creation Track Record** (Very Important) - Core competency for role success
6. **Technology Platform Experience** (Important) - Efficiency and modernization driver
7. **Advanced Education & Certifications** (Nice to Have) - Differentiators but not essential if experience strong
8. **Cultural Fit with Academic Environment** (Important) - Mission-driven experience reduces culture shock

### Red Flags to Watch:
- **No institutional or public sector experience** - May struggle with consensus decision-making, governance complexity, mission balance
- **Single asset class background** - Insufficient for mixed-use portfolio complexity
- **No student housing or multi-residential experience** - Critical gap given portfolio composition
- **Limited team leadership** - Individual contributors or small team managers insufficient for 7-person senior team
- **No partnership/JV experience** - Real Estate Partnerships mandate requires this capability
- **Purely private equity or transactional background** - May prioritize short-term financial returns over long-term mission alignment
- **No board or C-suite engagement** - Role requires executive presence and influence at highest levels
