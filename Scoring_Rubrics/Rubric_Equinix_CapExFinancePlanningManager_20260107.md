## Evidence Verification Framework

### CRITICAL: Evidence-Based Scoring Requirements

Before finalizing any score:

1. **Evidence Citation Requirement**: For every score above "Basic" (1 point):
   - Quote specific CV text supporting the score
   - Identify exact CV section/line numbers
   - Distinguish between direct experience vs transferable skills
   - Verify claimed experience duration and recency

2. **Domain Specificity Verification**: NEVER assume domain equivalency without explicit evidence:
   - Data center finance ≠ general corporate finance
   - Real estate asset management → adjacent but different from data center CAM
   - Manufacturing CapEx → transferable with justification

3. **Experience Type Classification**:
   - **Direct**: Exact same role/industry/function as job requirement
   - **Adjacent**: Related but different (specify differences)
   - **Transferable**: Different but applicable skills (justify transfer logic)
   - **Assumed**: No explicit evidence (score as "None" or "Basic" only)

4. **Quantitative Verification**:
   - Verify portfolio sizes, budget amounts, team sizes are explicitly stated
   - Distinguish between managed vs contributed to vs exposed to
   - Check timeframes and ensure experience is recent/relevant

---

## Role-Specific Considerations

### Industry Context:
- Data center infrastructure is capital-intensive ($455B global CapEx in 2024)
- Equinix is the world's largest data center company by revenue
- Role supports "billions of dollars in investment decisions"
- Growing complexity from AI infrastructure investment

### Transferability Assessment:
- Real estate asset management experience is ADJACENT (similar asset lifecycle concepts, different technical domain)
- Utility infrastructure experience is ADJACENT (similar capital intensity, different asset types)
- Manufacturing CapEx is TRANSFERABLE (budget cycles, but different asset characteristics)
- General corporate FP&A is TRANSFERABLE (planning skills, but lacks asset-intensive focus)

### Competitive Landscape:
- Toronto salary range: CAD $139,000 - $209,000
- Role requires rare combination: financial acumen + technical understanding + data visualization
- CFA/CPA preferred suggests rigorous analytical standards expected
- Individual contributor role suggests deep expertise valued over management experience
