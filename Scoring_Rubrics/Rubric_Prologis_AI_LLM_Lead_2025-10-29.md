## Scoring Guidelines
**MANDATORY: Include complete scoring interpretation from framework rubric**

### Overall Score Ranges:
- **90-100**: Exceptional candidate - exceeds requirements significantly; ready for immediate impact with deep LLM expertise and production experience
- **80-89**: Excellent candidate - strong match, minor gaps if any; solid LLM background with deployment experience
- **70-79**: Good candidate - solid match, some development areas; adequate AI/ML skills with growing LLM focus
- **60-69**: Potential candidate - meets core requirements, notable gaps; early-career or transitioning to LLM specialization
- **50-59**: Borderline candidate - significant gaps, consider if high potential; limited LLM experience but strong fundamentals
- **Below 50**: Not recommended - major gaps in critical areas; insufficient AI/ML or LLM experience

## Usage Guidelines

### When Scoring:
1. Review job description thoroughly before scoring - focus on "building from 0 to 1" and strategic AI applications
2. Map each requirement to candidate's experience - prioritize hands-on LLM and production deployment experience
3. Look for evidence, not assumptions - verify claims with specific projects, technologies, and outcomes
4. Consider recency of experience (weight recent more heavily) - AI/ML field evolves rapidly; recent LLM work valued highly
5. Account for career progression and growth trajectory - rapid skill acquisition in emerging technologies

### Critical Factors:
- Any "must-have" requirement scored below 2 may disqualify (Python, LLM experience, ML fundamentals)
- LLM experience (Section 1.2) is critical - score of <2 is major concern
- Production deployment experience (Section 3.2.3) essential - theoretical knowledge insufficient
- Business translation ability (Section 3.2.4) key differentiator - technical skills must connect to business value

### Documentation:
- Note specific examples supporting each score (project names, technologies used, outcomes achieved)
- Document concerns or areas needing clarification (gaps in vector database experience, limited fine-tuning work)
- Identify questions for interview follow-up (depth of RAG implementation, scale of LLM deployments)
- Record any special circumstances or context (self-taught with strong portfolio, career pivot to AI)

## Role-Specific Considerations

### Prologis Context:
- **Industry Leadership**: Prologis is the global leader in logistics real estate ($1.3B sq ft portfolio, $3.2T annual throughput)
- **Innovation Focus**: Company emphasizes AI (81%), automation (81%), data analytics (80%), sustainability (79%) as essential
- **Cultural Philosophy**: "Culture is the only form of sustainable competitive advantage" - values people who are decisive, courageous, adaptable
- **2025 Vision**: Preparing for "polycrisis" convergence; 2025 as turning point for AI/automation ROI in supply chains

### Real Estate + AI Unique Requirements:
- Lease abstraction, tenant communication, investment memo summarization require domain understanding
- Document-heavy industry benefits from NLP/LLM applications
- Asset-heavy business model creates unique data challenges and opportunities
- Supply chain optimization and logistics intelligence emerging focus areas

### Competitive Landscape:
- Salary range $135K-$190K reflects competitive AI/ML market (San Francisco Bay Area)
- Role requires rare combination: technical depth + business acumen + 0-to-1 building capability
- Strong candidates will have offers from tech companies; Prologis must sell mission and impact
- Real estate domain experience is differentiator but not requirement

### Success Indicators:
- Proven ability to ship LLM applications to production (not just experiments)
- Evidence of rapid learning and adaptation to new AI technologies
- Track record of translating business problems to technical solutions
- Comfort with ambiguity and building in uncharted territory
- Balance of technical depth and strategic business thinking
