## Evidence Verification Framework

**MANDATORY**: Apply these verification protocols when scoring candidates:

1. **CV Citation Required**: Every score >=2 must cite specific CV evidence with line numbers
2. **Distinguish Experience Types**: Direct (exact match) vs Adjacent vs Transferable vs Assumed
3. **Verify Recency**: AI/ML experience must be recent (2023-2025) for full credit
4. **Quantify Claims**: Metrics-based achievements require specific numbers from CV
5. **Production vs Academic**: Clearly distinguish deployed production work from academic projects
6. **Customer Evidence**: Customer-facing claims need specific project/client examples
