## Evidence Verification Framework

*Per `.claude/templates/evidence_verification_framework.md`*

### Mandatory Verification Requirements:
1. All scores >=2 require specific CV citations with line numbers
2. Years of experience must be verified against employment history
3. Portfolio sizes, AUM, team sizes must be explicitly stated (not assumed from titles)
4. Distinguish between direct vs. adjacent vs. transferable experience
5. Verify recency of skills (prioritize last 5 years of experience)

### Domain Specificity Check:
- Real estate asset management ≠ corporate real estate management
- REIT experience ≠ third-party fund management (note differences)
- Canadian market experience to be weighted higher than international only
- Ontario-specific market knowledge is a plus

### Red Flags to Verify:
- High scores across all technical skills without supporting projects
- Leadership claims without team size evidence
- Transaction volume claims without deal specifics
- Gap between titles and actual responsibilities demonstrated
