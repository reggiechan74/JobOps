- **70-79**: Good candidate - solid match with some development areas, meets requirements with room to grow

- **50-59**: Borderline candidate - significant gaps in critical areas, consider only if unique circumstances or scarce talent market
- **Below 50**: Not recommended - major gaps in critical areas, does not meet minimum requirements for role

## Usage Guidelines

### When Scoring:
1. **Review Requirements Thoroughly**: Map job description requirements (technical skills, experience, responsibilities) to candidate's CV before scoring
2. **Evidence-Based Assessment**: Look for specific examples, metrics, and documented achievements; avoid assumptions or inference beyond stated experience
3. **Recency Weighting**: Weight recent experience (last 5 years) more heavily than historical roles; 10+ year old experience has limited relevance unless highly unique
4. **Career Progression**: Consider trajectory and growth; consistent advancement indicates higher potential
5. **Industry Translation**: Understand transferability; real estate/infrastructure experience translates well, but verify scale and complexity match
6. **Citation Requirement**: For any score ≥2, cite specific CV section/line numbers as evidence

### Critical Factors:
- **Must-Have Requirements**: Private markets experience (7-10 years), portfolio management capabilities, stakeholder management skills, Bachelor's degree
- **Disqualifying Gaps**: Any required skill scored 0-1 may disqualify; <5 years relevant experience is significant concern
- **Competitive Threshold**: Scores <70 unlikely to be competitive for Associate Director role at institutional pension fund
- **Pension Fund Context**: Pure corporate real estate, development-only, or property management roles without investment decision-making are less relevant

### Documentation:
- **Evidence Citations**: Note specific CV examples supporting each score (e.g., "Artis REIT portfolio management: 4M sf, $865M AUM")
- **Gap Identification**: Document concerns or areas needing interview validation
- **Follow-Up Questions**: Record questions for interview to clarify ambiguities or probe depth
- **Special Circumstances**: Note unique qualifications or experiences that may compensate for apparent gaps

## Role-Specific Considerations
**MANDATORY: Add specific considerations based on job posting analysis**

### UPP-Specific Context:
- **Start-Up Pension Fund**: UPP established 2021, rapidly building private markets program; values entrepreneurial mindset and ability to build from ground up
- **Growth Phase**: Target allocation 20% private markets (~$1.6B at maturity) with $900M already committed/invested; requires scaling capabilities
- **12-Month Contract**: Fixed-term role suggests specific project/build-out focus; strong onboarding and immediate contribution ability critical
- **Infrastructure Lead Reporting**: Senior Director, Infrastructure Lead is direct supervisor; infrastructure sector knowledge highly valued
- **Multi-Asset Class Coordination**: Role spans infrastructure, real estate, PE, credit; breadth across asset classes more important than deep specialization in one
- **University Sector Culture**: Academic institutional environment; values intellectual rigor, collaboration, equity/diversity, long-term thinking
- **Responsible Investing Leader**: UPP positions itself as RI leader; ESG integration and climate change focus are strategic priorities
- **One Fund Mindset**: Emphasizes collaboration across investment team; silos or territorial behavior would be cultural misfit

### Market Considerations:
- **Private Markets Boom**: Infrastructure posted 11.9% returns (2024), private markets growing to $20T by 2030; high-demand environment for talent
- **Canadian Pension Funds**: CPP Investments, IMCO, OTPP, bcIMC are primary competitors for talent; benchmarking against these organizations appropriate
- **Hybrid Work Norm**: Post-COVID standard in Canadian institutional investing; Toronto-based with 2 days in-office minimum is market-standard
- **Compensation Expectations**: Associate Director at Canadian pension fund typically C$150K-$200K base + bonus; total comp C$200K-$300K depending on experience
- **Talent Scarcity**: 7-10 years private markets experience with pension fund knowledge is relatively scarce in Canadian market; may require trade-offs

### Red Flags to Assess:
- **Limited Investment Experience**: Pure operational, development, or property management background without investment decision-making
- **No Portfolio Management**: Individual asset management without broader portfolio responsibility or strategic thinking
- **Weak Stakeholder Skills**: Limited IC/board exposure or inability to communicate with senior stakeholders
- **Short-Term Focus**: Transactional mindset vs. long-term value creation orientation
- **Solo Operator**: Inability to collaborate or share knowledge across teams; "one fund" mindset essential
- **No Private Markets**: Exclusively public markets or corporate finance background without private asset experience

### Competitive Advantages:
- **Canadian Pension Fund Experience**: Direct experience at OTPP, CPP Investments, IMCO, bcIMC, HOOPP highly valued
- **Private Markets Breadth**: Experience across multiple asset classes (infrastructure AND real estate or PE) vs. single-asset class specialization
- **ESG Leadership**: Proven track record integrating ESG factors into investment processes; published work or policy development
- **Technology Savvy**: Experience with investment management systems, data analytics, process automation (UPP values innovation)
- **Entrepreneurial Track Record**: Start-up or build-out experience; creating frameworks, processes, teams from scratch
- **Thought Leadership**: Published articles, conference presentations, industry recognition demonstrating expertise and profile
