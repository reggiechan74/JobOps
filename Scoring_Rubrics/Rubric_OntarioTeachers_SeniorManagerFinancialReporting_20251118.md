## Scoring Guidelines
**MANDATORY: Include complete scoring interpretation from framework rubric**

### Overall Score Ranges:
- **90-100**: Exceptional candidate - exceeds requirements significantly; ready to excel in role immediately with deep pension/financial institution reporting expertise
- **80-89**: Excellent candidate - strong match with minor gaps if any; likely to succeed with brief onboarding
- **70-79**: Good candidate - solid match with some development areas; can grow into full scope of role
- **60-69**: Potential candidate - meets core requirements with notable gaps; significant development needed in pension accounting or policy areas
- **50-59**: Borderline candidate - significant gaps in critical areas (e.g., limited IFRS, no consolidation experience); consider only if high potential and willing to invest in development
- **Below 50**: Not recommended - major gaps in critical areas (no CPA, insufficient years of experience, no financial reporting background)

## Usage Guidelines

### When Using This Rubric:
1. Review job description thoroughly before scoring any candidate
2. Map each requirement to candidate's experience systematically using evidence from resume
3. Look for evidence, not assumptions - apply Evidence Verification Framework rigorously
4. Consider recency of experience (weight recent pension/IFRS work more heavily than old experience)
5. Account for career progression - look for upward trajectory into increasingly complex financial reporting roles

### Critical Factors:
- **CPA designation is mandatory** - any candidate without CPA scores 0 in certifications and should be carefully evaluated
- **IFRS and consolidation experience are essential** - low scores in technical skills (Section 1) may disqualify
- **10+ years experience is firm requirement** - candidates below 10 years should be exceptional in other areas to compensate
- **Pension plan or Big 4 pension practice experience is highly preferred** - adjacent industries require strong transferability case
- Consider minimum acceptable scores for each category:
  - Technical Skills: Minimum 10/25 (need core IFRS and consolidation capability)
  - Experience: Minimum 15/25 (must meet years and have relevant background)
  - Certifications: Minimum 2/4 (CPA is non-negotiable)

### Documentation:
- Note specific examples supporting each score with resume page/section references
- Document concerns or areas needing clarification in interview
- Identify questions for interview follow-up (e.g., depth of Section 4600 knowledge, consolidation complexity handled)
- Record any special circumstances or context (e.g., career breaks, industry transitions)

## Role-Specific Considerations

### Unique Aspects of This Role:
1. **Dual Focus on Financial Reporting AND Accounting Policy**: Many organizations separate these functions. This role requires both operational excellence (delivering timely, accurate financial statements) and technical depth (researching complex accounting issues, developing policies). Candidates must demonstrate both skill sets.

2. **Pension Plan Complexity**: Section 4600 (Canadian accounting standards for pension plans) is specialized knowledge. Candidates from pure IFRS backgrounds (corporate) will need to learn pension-specific accounting. Preference for candidates with pension plan, Big 4 pension practice, or fund accounting backgrounds.

3. **High-Visibility Governance Role**: Regular interaction with Audit & Actuarial Committee (Board-level) and rating agencies requires maturity, judgment, and exceptional communication skills. This is not a behind-the-scenes role.

4. **Technology-Forward Environment**: Emphasis on advanced finance tools (Power BI, Alteryx, Workiva, Python, Snowflake) signals Ontario Teachers' commitment to innovation. Candidates with technology resistance or limited adaptability will struggle.

5. **Consolidation Complexity**: Ontario Teachers' has investment subsidiaries and administrative entities across multiple jurisdictions. Understanding VIEs, intercompany eliminations, and foreign operations is critical.

6. **External Audit Intensity**: Big 4 audits of pension plans are rigorous with high regulatory scrutiny. Candidates must demonstrate ability to manage demanding audit processes professionally.

7. **Competitive Market**: Ontario Teachers' is one of Canada's premier pension plans ($243B+ AUM). Competition for this role will be strong, likely attracting candidates from other large pension plans (CPPIB, OMERS, HOOPP, AIMCo), Big 4 pension practices, and major asset managers.

### Market Conditions & Compensation Context (2025):
- Senior Manager Financial Reporting roles in large pension plans typically command $120K-$165K base plus bonus and defined benefit pension
- Candidates currently at Big 4 may be motivated by better work-life balance and pension benefits
- Hybrid work arrangements are increasingly expected by top candidates
- Shortage of candidates with deep Section 4600 knowledge may require hiring strong IFRS candidates and training on pension-specific requirements

### Red Flags to Watch For:
- Candidates with ONLY corporate IFRS experience (no fund/pension/financial institution background) - may struggle with investment accounting complexity
- Job hoppers with <2 years tenure in recent roles - concerning for role requiring deep institutional knowledge
- No audit management experience - critical skill gap for this role
- Limited technical writing samples - policy development requires strong written communication
- Overreliance on systems/tools without accounting judgment - this role requires technical expertise, not just Excel skills
