## Scoring Guidelines
**MANDATORY: Include complete scoring interpretation from framework rubric**

### Overall Score Ranges:
- **90-100**: Exceptional candidate - exceeds requirements significantly, ready for immediate impact, minimal onboarding needed
- **80-89**: Excellent candidate - strong match with minor gaps if any, likely to succeed with normal onboarding
- **70-79**: Good candidate - solid match with some development areas, will require focused onboarding in gap areas
- **60-69**: Potential candidate - meets core requirements but notable gaps exist, higher risk/development needs
- **50-59**: Borderline candidate - significant gaps in critical areas, consider only if exceptional potential or unique circumstances
- **Below 50**: Not recommended - major gaps in multiple critical areas, unlikely to succeed in role

## Usage Guidelines

### When Using This Rubric:
1. Review job description thoroughly before scoring any candidate
2. Map each requirement to candidate's experience systematically
3. Look for evidence, not assumptions - apply evidence-based scoring verification framework
4. Consider recency of experience (weight recent more heavily) - real estate market has changed significantly 2020-2025
5. Account for career progression and growth trajectory toward this role

### Critical Factors:
- Any "must-have" requirement scored below 2 (Proficient) may disqualify - particularly Asset Management, Development, and Strategic Leadership
- Minimum acceptable scores: Technical Skills (18/25), Experience (18/25), Responsibilities (14/20) to be viable candidate
- 20 years progressive experience is hard requirement - candidates with <18 years unlikely to have necessary depth
- Enterprise/national oversight experience critical - regional-only candidates face steep learning curve

### Documentation:
- Note specific examples supporting each score with CV citations and line numbers
- Document concerns or areas needing clarification for interview
- Identify questions for interview follow-up on gap areas
- Record any special circumstances or context affecting scoring

## Role-Specific Considerations

### Market Context
- Colliers recently acquired Triovest (2024-2025), now Canada's largest CRE services firm with 3,000+ professionals
- Post-acquisition integration will be critical challenge requiring change management and culture-building skills
- Strong real estate fundamentals post-pandemic but capital markets uncertainty requires sophisticated financing skills
- Technology disruption (PropTech, AI) creating competitive advantages for early adopters
- ESG becoming table stakes for institutional investors - candidates without sustainability track record will need rapid upskilling

### Competitive Landscape
- Competing with CBRE, JLL, Cushman & Wakefield, Avison Young for top talent and mandates
- Institutional investors (pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth) driving demand for integrated services
- Co-investment and JV structures increasingly preferred over traditional fee-only relationships
- Development expertise differentiator as construction costs and complexity increase

### Success Factors Beyond Rubric
- Cultural integration skills given Triovest acquisition
- Existing relationships with Canadian institutional investors (CPPIB, OMERS, AIMCo, bcIMC, OTPP, PSP, etc.)
- Understanding of Canadian real estate market dynamics vs U.S. or global
- Ability to balance entrepreneurial drive with corporate governance in large organization
- Comfort with ambiguity and building new integrated service model

### Interview Focus Areas
- Probe track record of business development and new mandate wins with specific examples and revenue figures
- Validate scale of portfolios and developments managed - ask for specific properties, values, performance metrics
- Assess integration experience - how have they combined different business units or post-acquisition?
- Test institutional investor knowledge - which institutions have they worked with? What are their priorities?
- Explore innovation mindset - what technologies have they championed? What was the ROI?
- Understand leadership philosophy - how do they build high-performance teams? Examples of mentoring senior leaders?

## CRITICAL: EVIDENCE-BASED SCORING VERIFICATION

Before finalizing any assessment score, assessors MUST apply the Evidence-Based Scoring Verification Framework:

### 1. Evidence Citation Requirement
For every score above "Basic" (1 point), you MUST:
- Quote specific CV text supporting the score
- Identify exact CV section/line numbers
- Distinguish between direct experience vs transferable skills
- Verify claimed experience duration and recency

### 2. Domain Specificity Verification
NEVER assume domain equivalency without explicit evidence:
- Real estate asset management ≠ infrastructure asset management ≠ financial asset management
- Development management ≠ development accounting ≠ construction management
- Institutional real estate ≠ private real estate ≠ residential real estate
- REIT experience ≠ pension fund ≠ insurance company ≠ private equity

### 3. Experience Type Classification
Before scoring, verify and classify experience as:
- **Direct**: Commercial real estate asset management/development at institutional scale
- **Adjacent**: Related real estate functions (property management at scale, REIT operations, pension fund real estate)
- **Transferable**: Different but applicable (infrastructure asset management, corporate real estate, private equity)
- **Assumed**: No explicit evidence (score as "None" or "Basic" only)

### 4. Cross-Reference Protocol
Before scoring each section:
- Ask: "Where exactly in the CV does this evidence appear?"
- Verify: Does the evidence match the specific requirement (not just related)?
- Challenge: What evidence contradicts a high score?
- Validate: Are years of experience and seniority consistent with claimed expertise?

### 5. Quantitative Verification
For any metrics-based scoring:
- Verify AUM/portfolio sizes are explicitly stated (not inferred from company size)
- Distinguish between managed directly vs oversaw vs contributed to
- Check timeframes - is experience recent or outdated (>5 years old may be less relevant)
- Validate geographic scope - single market vs multi-market vs national

### 6. Quality Control Checklist
□ Every score ≥2 has specific CV citation with line numbers
□ Industry experience explicitly verified (not assumed based on company)
□ Years of experience match claimed specialization level (20 years required)
□ Leadership scope verified vs assumed (team sizes, budget accountability documented)
□ Technical skills backed by specific project examples with outcomes
□ Achievement metrics directly quoted from CV (not rounded or estimated)
□ No conflation of real estate sub-sectors or asset classes

### 7. Scoring Revision Protocol
If evidence doesn't support initial score:
- Immediately revise score downward to match actual evidence
- Document the correction reasoning in assessment notes
- Recalculate total score and recommendation level
- Update executive summary to reflect corrected analysis

### 8. Red Flag Verification
Automatically verify when scoring shows:
- High scores (≥3) across multiple categories - ensure not inflating based on assumptions
- Claims of 20+ years experience - verify with employment dates and career timeline
- Leadership claims - verify actual team sizes and reporting structures documented
- Portfolio size claims - ensure AUM figures are stated, not inferred
- Perfect technical skills alignment - challenge whether all skills truly at Expert level
