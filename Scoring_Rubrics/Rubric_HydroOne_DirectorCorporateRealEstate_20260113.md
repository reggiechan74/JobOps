### Unique Role Aspects:
- Dual nature: Real estate AND facilities management combined
- Critical infrastructure: Facilities support electrical grid operations
- Regulatory overlay: Rate case applications, OEB compliance
- Union environment: Labour relations considerations

- Scale: >1,500 buildings is substantial portfolio for any organization

### Competitive Differentiation:
