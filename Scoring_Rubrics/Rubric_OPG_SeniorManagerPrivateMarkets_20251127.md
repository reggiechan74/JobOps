## Scoring Guidelines

**MANDATORY: Complete scoring interpretation**

### Overall Score Ranges:
- **90-100**: Exceptional candidate - exceeds requirements significantly; strong institutional private markets background with infrastructure/PE expertise
- **80-89**: Excellent candidate - strong match with deep relevant experience; minor development areas
- **70-79**: Good candidate - solid match with transferable skills; some development needed in specific areas
- **60-69**: Potential candidate - meets core requirements but notable gaps in private markets or institutional experience
- **50-59**: Borderline candidate - significant gaps; consider only if exceptional potential demonstrated
- **Below 50**: Not recommended - major gaps in critical private markets investment requirements

---

## Usage Guidelines

### When Using This Rubric:
1. Review job description thoroughly before scoring any candidate
2. Map each requirement to candidate's experience systematically
3. Look for evidence, not assumptions - quote specific examples
4. Consider recency of experience (weight recent private markets experience more heavily)
5. Account for career progression and institutional exposure trajectory

### Critical Factors:
- Private markets investment experience is essential - score below 2 in this area may disqualify
- Institutional investor experience (pension fund, endowment) strongly preferred
- CFA designation is explicitly mentioned as an asset
- 10-year minimum experience is a firm requirement

### Documentation:
- Note specific examples supporting each score with source file and line numbers
- Document concerns or areas needing clarification
- Identify questions for interview follow-up
- Record any special circumstances or context

---

## Evidence Verification Framework

**MANDATORY APPLICATION** - Apply these protocols when scoring:

### Evidence Citation Requirement
For every score above "Basic" (1 point):
- Quote specific CV text supporting the score
- Identify exact CV section/line numbers
- Distinguish between direct experience vs transferable skills
- Verify claimed experience duration and recency

### Domain Specificity Verification
NEVER assume domain equivalency without explicit evidence:
- Private markets ≠ public markets ≠ real estate operations
- Pension fund experience ≠ REIT experience ≠ corporate finance
- Infrastructure investment ≠ infrastructure construction ≠ utilities operations

### Experience Type Classification
- **Direct**: Institutional private markets investment management
- **Adjacent**: Real asset management, fund management serving institutions
- **Transferable**: Real estate asset management, financial analysis with some PE/infrastructure exposure
- **Assumed**: No explicit evidence (score as "None" or "Basic" only)

---

### OPG Context
- One of Canada's largest single-employer pension plans (~22,000 members)
- Combined $35B+ in pension and nuclear funds

### Market Context

### Candidate Differentiators to Look For
- Direct pension fund or nuclear fund experience
- Infrastructure investment specialization
- Canadian market knowledge
- Public sector or regulated environment experience
- CFA designation as explicit plus factor
