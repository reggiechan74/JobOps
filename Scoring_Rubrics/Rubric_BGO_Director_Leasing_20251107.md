## Scoring Guidelines
**MANDATORY: Include complete scoring interpretation from framework rubric**

### Overall Score Ranges:
- **90-100**: Exceptional candidate - significantly exceeds requirements, proven GTA industrial leasing expert, immediate impact expected, minimal risk
- **80-89**: Excellent candidate - strong match with minor gaps if any, experienced professional ready for director role, low-risk hire
- **70-79**: Good candidate - solid match with some development areas, capable professional requiring modest ramp-up, acceptable risk level
- **60-69**: Potential candidate - meets core requirements with notable gaps, may require significant support/development, moderate risk
- **50-59**: Borderline candidate - significant gaps in critical areas, consider only if high potential demonstrated, high risk
- **Below 50**: Not recommended - major gaps in multiple critical areas, insufficient qualification for director-level role

## Usage Guidelines

### When Scoring:
1. **Review Requirements Thoroughly**: Understand BGO's institutional REIT environment, GTA industrial market focus, third-party client management expectations, and director-level scope requirements
2. **Evidence-Based Scoring**: Map each requirement to specific candidate experience with concrete examples - distinguish between direct experience, adjacent experience, and transferable skills
3. **Avoid Assumptions**: Look for documented evidence, not potential or assumptions - require specific examples for scores above "Basic" (1 point)
4. **Recency Matters**: Weight recent experience (last 3-5 years) more heavily than dated experience - industrial leasing market has evolved significantly with technology, ESG requirements, and institutional practices
5. **Career Trajectory**: Consider progression and growth trajectory - consistent advancement and increasing responsibility indicate strong candidate even if absolute experience level is at lower end of range
6. **Domain Specificity**: GTA industrial leasing is specialized - do not assume equivalency with office/retail or other markets without explicit evidence of transferability

### Critical Factors:
- **Must-Have Requirements** (Potential Disqualifiers if Below Threshold):

  - Financial analysis capability for leasing decisions (minimum 2 points in technical skills)
  - Institutional real estate background (minimum 5 points in Industry/Domain Experience)

- **Interview Focus Areas**: Identify 5-7 priority topics requiring deeper exploration based on scoring gaps or ambiguous evidence

### Role-Specific Considerations
**MANDATORY: Add specific considerations based on job posting analysis**

**GTA Industrial Market Context (2025):**
- **Tenant-Favorable Market**: Current market conditions with rising vacancy (5.0%, 10-year high), declining rents (-7.0% YoY), and sublease availability at highest levels since 2010 create challenging leasing environment - candidates with proven performance through market cycles particularly valuable
- **Sophisticated Negotiation Required**: Tenants have leverage and options - director must balance occupancy maintenance with rental rate defense, requiring sophisticated negotiation skills and creative deal structuring
- **Market Intelligence Critical**: With rapid market changes and increased competition, real-time market knowledge and strong broker relationships essential for deal flow and competitive positioning
- **Relationship-Driven Success**: Off-market deals and tenant retention increasingly important as on-market competition intensifies - candidate's broker network and tenant relationships highly valuable

**BGO Organizational Context:**
- **Institutional REIT Platform**: BGO (BentallGreenOak) is major global real estate investment advisor ($89B AUM, 750+ institutional clients) requiring sophisticated financial reporting, investment committee processes, and client management - candidates without institutional REIT/pension fund experience may require significant cultural adaptation
- **Third-Party Client Management**: Role involves direct interface with institutional clients requiring high-caliber communication, professionalism, and client service orientation - track record of client satisfaction essential
- **Sun Life Affiliation**: As part of SLC Management (Sun Life), BGO emphasizes integrity, responsible investing, ESG/DEI commitment, long-term orientation, and conservative risk management - cultural alignment with these values important
- **Portfolio Scale**: Managing GTA industrial portfolio likely 1-4M sf with $750M-$1B+ value across 10-40 properties requires director-level experience with multi-asset coordination, capital allocation, and strategic prioritization

**Technology & Systems:**
- **VTS Platform**: Job posting lists "Advanced skills in Excel, Word, VTS, PowerPoint" as required - VTS (leasing management platform) experience strongly preferred given it's specifically named; candidates without VTS but with other PropTech platforms (Yardi, MRI) can adapt but may have learning curve
- **Financial Modeling**: Advanced Excel skills essential for NER analysis, cash flow modeling, and investment committee presentations - candidates with sophisticated financial modeling capabilities (DCF, sensitivity analysis, scenario planning) have significant advantage

**Strategic Focus Areas:**
- **Value Maximization**: Job emphasizes "maximizing asset value" and "ideally exceed business plan targets" - candidates with proven track record of rental rate premiums and creative value-creation strategies particularly valuable
- **Acquisition Support**: Role includes "assist with asset and land acquisitions providing market knowledge" and "possess extensive knowledge of New Development Pipeline" - candidates with acquisition underwriting experience or development knowledge offer additional value
- **Business Development**: Job mentions "be aware of and take advantage of new business development opportunities for BGO to grow our leasing and property management platform" - entrepreneurial candidates who can identify growth opportunities valued beyond core leasing execution

**Competitive Landscape:**
- This director role likely competes for talent with: Dream Industrial REIT, Granite REIT, Pure Industrial, SmartCentres, First Capital, Brookfield, Oxford Properties, CBRE (in-house landlord services), Colliers, Cushman & Wakefield, JLL
- Salary expectations for Director, Industrial Leasing in GTA with 7+ years typically $120K-$180K base + bonus (10-30%) + benefits/equity
- BGO's institutional platform, global scale, and Sun Life backing offer career growth potential and stability advantages over smaller private owners
