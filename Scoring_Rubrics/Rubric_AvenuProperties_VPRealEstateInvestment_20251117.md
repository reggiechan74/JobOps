## Scoring Guidelines
**MANDATORY: Include complete scoring interpretation from framework rubric**

### Overall Score Ranges:
- **90-100**: Exceptional candidate - exceeds requirements significantly; ready for immediate impact at VP level with track record of transformational achievements
- **80-89**: Excellent candidate - strong match with minor gaps if any; proven VP-level or senior director capabilities across most areas
- **70-79**: Good candidate - solid match with some development areas; director-level with growth potential or VP-level with specific capability gaps
- **60-69**: Potential candidate - meets core requirements with notable gaps; capable manager-level with stretch potential or director-level needing support in key areas
- **50-59**: Borderline candidate - significant gaps in critical areas; consider only if high potential and organizational support available for development
- **Below 50**: Not recommended - major gaps in critical areas; insufficient experience, skills, or track record for VP-level role requirements

## Usage Guidelines

### When Scoring:
1. Review job description thoroughly before scoring
2. Map each requirement to candidate's experience with specific evidence citations
3. Look for evidence, not assumptions - distinguish between direct experience, adjacent experience, and inferred capabilities
4. Consider recency of experience (weight recent experience more heavily; discount experience >10 years old)
5. Account for career progression and growth trajectory - evaluate if candidate has demonstrated continuous advancement
6. Assess transferability carefully - corporate real estate differs from REIT/advisory contexts in stakeholder complexity and strategic integration

### Critical Factors:
- 10+ years corporate real estate experience is mandatory - any score <5 in Years of Experience section should raise concerns
- M&A due diligence and transaction leadership are core requirements - scores <2 in these areas are red flags
- Strong commercial leasing negotiation skills are essential - scores <2 indicate significant gaps
- MBA or master's degree is strongly preferred for VP-level - candidates without advanced degrees should demonstrate exceptional experience (15+ years)
- Leadership and team management experience expected at VP level - individual contributors without management track record are not suitable

### Documentation:
- Note specific examples supporting each score with CV line references
- Document concerns or areas needing clarification
- Identify questions for interview follow-up
- Record any special circumstances or context affecting scoring
- Flag any assumptions made due to limited information

### Evidence Requirements:
- Every score ≥2 must have specific CV citation
- Distinguish between claimed experience vs. demonstrated results
- Verify metrics and achievement claims align with role scope
- Cross-reference experience levels with tenure and compensation progression
- Note any discrepancies or inconsistencies requiring clarification

## Role-Specific Considerations

### Avenu Properties Context
- **Portfolio Diversity**: GTA-focused portfolio with residential developments, income properties, land parcels, office/retail/commercial assets requires versatile real estate expertise across multiple asset classes
- **Transaction Focus**: Role emphasizes leading transactions and negotiations - transactional real estate background more relevant than pure asset management
- **M&A Integration**: Specific requirement for M&A due diligence expertise suggests growth through acquisition strategy - prior M&A experience highly valued
- **Stakeholder Complexity**: Relationships with business owners, landlords, asset managers, suppliers indicate need for sophisticated relationship management and diplomacy
- **Strategic Orientation**: Portfolio rationalization, cost savings identification, and investment opportunities suggest strategic thinking beyond operational execution
- **Geographic Scope**: "Americas region" indicates potential for cross-border transactions (US, Latin America) - international real estate experience valuable
- **Entrepreneurial Culture**: Company description emphasizes entrepreneurial environment and innovation - candidates with startup, development, or opportunistic investment backgrounds may fit culture well
- **Mandarin Proficiency**: Listed as an asset, suggesting potential for international stakeholder engagement or Chinese investor relationships

### Industry Trends (2025)
- Corporate real estate increasingly strategic post-COVID with portfolio rationalization emphasis
- M&A activity requiring sophisticated real estate due diligence capabilities
- Technology adoption in lease administration and portfolio management (VTS, Argus, PropTech)
- ESG considerations in real estate investment and management decisions
- Hybrid work impact on office space strategies
- Supply chain considerations affecting industrial/warehouse portfolio decisions

### Competitive Landscape
- VP Real Estate Investment roles typically require 12-15 years experience in competitive markets
- MBA + CFA or RICS designation combinations increasingly common for senior roles
- Transaction leadership experience with $100M+ career volume expected
- M&A real estate expertise at premium due to integration complexity
- Bilingual capabilities (English + Mandarin) provide competitive advantage in GTA market with significant Chinese investment

### Red Flags to Watch
- Lack of transactional real estate experience (pure asset management background)
- No M&A exposure in increasingly acquisition-driven corporate real estate environment
- Limited lease negotiation experience despite being core requirement
- Individual contributor without team management track record
- Narrow asset class expertise (e.g., office-only) when role requires versatility
- Absence of quantified achievements or metrics
- Limited stakeholder management experience
- No advanced degree (MBA/master's) without compensating exceptional experience (20+ years)
