- **60-69**: Potential candidate - meets core requirements, notable gaps in retail experience or leadership scope
- **50-59**: Borderline candidate - significant gaps in retail asset management or national-scale experience, consider if high potential and coachable
- **Below 50**: Not recommended - major gaps in critical areas (retail experience, team leadership, capital project expertise, or required years of experience)

## Usage Guidelines

### When Scoring:
1. Review job description thoroughly before scoring - focus on retail asset management distinctiveness
2. Map each requirement to candidate's experience - distinguish retail from other real estate sectors
3. Look for evidence, not assumptions - verify national vs regional vs local scope
4. Consider recency of experience (weight recent more heavily) - retail experience from last 5 years most relevant
5. Account for career progression and growth trajectory - AVP-level maturity and executive presence

### Critical Factors:
- **10 years asset management** is minimum threshold - score 0 in Years of Experience if below
- **5 years leadership** is minimum - evaluate team size and scope progression
- **Retail or multi-site experience** is highly preferred - single-asset institutional real estate may not transfer well
- **Dealer/franchise network** understanding is differentiator for Canadian Tire culture
- **Capital project delivery** track record is essential - must demonstrate construction management
- **Budget scale** matters - look for $25M+ annual budget responsibility

### Documentation:
- Note specific examples supporting each score with CV line references
- Document concerns or areas needing clarification - especially retail experience validation
- Identify questions for interview follow-up - dealer relationship experience, Canadian Tire knowledge
- Record any special circumstances or context - transferability of non-retail experience

## Role-Specific Considerations

### Canadian Tire Context:
- **Dealer Network**: 502 stores operated by independent Dealers who own fixtures, equipment, and inventory - unique relationship management requirement
- **CT REIT Relationship**: Separate publicly-traded REIT owns properties, requires coordination and liaison skills
- **National Scope**: 1,700+ retail locations across Canada requiring standardized processes and national team coordination
- **Customer-Centric**: Retail environment where asset quality directly impacts customer experience
- **Hands-On Culture**: Despite AVP title, expectation of tactical involvement and quick decision-making

### Key Differentiators:
- **Retail vs Institutional**: Retail asset management focuses on customer experience and store operations vs pure financial optimization
- **Multi-Site Complexity**: Managing hundreds of sites simultaneously vs deep focus on single trophy assets
- **Dealer Relationships**: Working with independent business owners vs corporate tenants
- **Maintenance Focus**: Proactive maintenance programs and reactive issue resolution vs lease-up and repositioning
- **Scale Prioritization**: Ability to standardize and scale processes vs bespoke solutions

### Competitive Landscape:
- Candidates from retail competitors (Loblaws, Walmart Canada, Home Depot Canada, Metro, Sobeys) will have strong cultural fit
- Commercial real estate candidates (CBRE, JLL, Colliers) will have professional approach but may lack retail operational understanding
- REIT candidates will have financial sophistication but may lack hands-on maintenance and construction focus
- Institutional real estate candidates may struggle with pace, dealer dynamics, and multi-site complexity

### Interview Focus Areas:
- Validate retail or multi-site experience depth and recency
- Explore dealer/franchise relationship management capabilities
- Assess balance of strategic thinking with hands-on execution
- Probe decision-making speed and comfort with ambiguity
- Evaluate team development and culture-building track record
- Test understanding of maintenance vs development asset management
