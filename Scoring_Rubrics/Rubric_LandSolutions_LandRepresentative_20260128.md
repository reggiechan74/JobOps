## Role-Specific Considerations

### Market Context (Ontario, 2026):
- Significant infrastructure investment in Ontario (transit expansion, power grid modernization, renewable energy)
- High demand for experienced land acquisition professionals
- Hourly rate ($35-$55/hr) is competitive for mid-level role but below senior consultant rates
- Remote work with travel is industry standard

### Critical Success Factors for This Role:
1. **Negotiation Skills**: Ability to achieve voluntary settlements is paramount; expropriation is costly and time-consuming
2. **Stakeholder Relationships**: Building trust with landowners and communities directly impacts project success
3. **Legal Document Proficiency**: Errors in land rights interpretation can have significant legal/financial consequences
4. **Field Readiness**: Must be comfortable with extensive travel and on-site stakeholder engagement
5. **Regulatory Knowledge**: Ontario-specific legislation (Expropriations Act, Environmental Assessment Act) knowledge is valuable

### Differentiation from Senior Roles:
- Land Representative is mid-level; senior roles involve program management, team leadership
- Focus on execution rather than strategy development
- Works within established frameworks rather than creating them
- Reports to project managers or program directors

---

## Usage Guidelines

### When Using This Rubric:
1. Review job description thoroughly before scoring any candidate
2. Map each requirement to candidate's experience systematically
3. Look for evidence, not assumptions
4. Consider recency of experience (weight recent more heavily)
5. Account for career progression and growth trajectory

### Critical Factors:
- Negotiation/conflict resolution skills are essential - score below 2 should be carefully evaluated

- Infrastructure sector experience significantly differentiates candidates
- Field work readiness is non-negotiable for this role

### Documentation:
- Note specific examples supporting each score
- Document concerns or areas needing clarification
- Identify questions for interview follow-up
- Record any special circumstances or context

### Evidence-Based Scoring Verification:
Before finalizing any score, verify:
- Quote specific CV text supporting scores above "Basic"
- Distinguish between direct experience vs transferable skills
- Verify claimed experience duration and recency
- Challenge assumptions - ask "Where exactly does this evidence appear?"
