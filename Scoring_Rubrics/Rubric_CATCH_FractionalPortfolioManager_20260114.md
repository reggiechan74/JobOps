## Scoring Guidelines

### Overall Score Ranges:
- **90-100**: Exceptional candidate - exceeds requirements significantly; ideal for senior CIO/Portfolio Manager role at community finance institution
- **80-89**: Excellent candidate - strong match for CATCH role; may need minor onboarding in specific areas (e.g., non-market housing sector)
- **70-79**: Good candidate - solid foundation in real estate/lending; development needed in community housing or impact investing areas
- **60-69**: Potential candidate - meets core investment/real estate requirements but significant gaps in community housing, blended capital, or lending experience
- **50-59**: Borderline candidate - real estate background but major gaps in lending, community focus, or appropriate scope
- **Below 50**: Not recommended - lacks foundational requirements for senior lending/investment role

### Critical Requirements Assessment:
Given CATCH's needs, the following are critical minimum thresholds:
- **Real Estate Underwriting**: Minimum 2/3 (Proficient) - lending experience is essential
- **Portfolio Risk Management**: Minimum 1/3 (Basic) - some credit monitoring experience required
- **Investor Relations**: Minimum 2/3 (Proficient) - role is investor-facing
- **Years Experience**: Minimum 5/6 (Meets) - senior role requires substantial track record

### Usage Guidelines

When Using This Rubric:
1. Review CATCH fund structure and mandate thoroughly
2. Map candidate's lending and investment experience to community housing context
3. Distinguish between commercial real estate asset management and actual lending experience
4. Consider recency of relevant experience (weight recent lending/credit work more heavily)
5. Evaluate mission alignment alongside technical competence

### Critical Factors:
- Lending/credit decision experience is essential - pure asset management without lending is insufficient
- Investor relations capability is critical for fractional senior role
- Balance between commercial discipline and mission alignment must be evident
- Track record of governance participation and board-level communication important

### Documentation:
- Note specific examples of lending transactions and credit decisions
- Document portfolio sizes, transaction counts, and outcomes
- Identify experience gaps requiring interview probing
- Record evidence of mission alignment or community housing exposure

## Role-Specific Considerations

### CATCH Fund Unique Aspects:
1. **Fractional Engagement Model**: 4-8 days/month requires highly efficient senior professional
2. **Startup Phase**: Fund is in capital close and launch phase through April 2026
3. **Lean Structure**: No institutional platform - works with City of Hamilton, back office provider, and small team
4. **Blended Capital Complexity**: First-loss catalytic + public + private capital structure
5. **Mission Duality**: Must balance "disciplined credit work and clear mission outcomes"
6. **National Scaling Ambition**: Hamilton pilot with plans for cross-Canada expansion

### Market Context (2025-2026):
- CMHC Affordable Housing Fund fully committed as of 2025
- Growing demand for alternative community housing financing
- Increasing focus on transit-oriented development in Canadian cities
- Rising interest in blended capital models for social impact

### Competitive Considerations:
- Limited pool of candidates with both senior lending experience AND community housing sector knowledge
- CDFI/community finance experience from US market may be relevant but requires Canadian context adaptation
- Commercial real estate professionals may have technical skills but lack mission alignment
- Non-profit housing sector professionals may have mission fit but lack investment/lending rigor
