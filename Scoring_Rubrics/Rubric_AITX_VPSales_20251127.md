- **80-89**: Excellent candidate - strong match, minor gaps (adjacent equipment leasing senior executive)
- **70-79**: Good candidate - solid match, some development areas (strong B2B sales with transferable skills)

- **50-59**: Borderline candidate - significant gaps (needs substantial industry ramp-up)
- **Below 50**: Not recommended - major gaps in critical areas (no relevant sales/leasing experience)

## Critical Qualification Gates

**Must-Have Requirements (failure in any = potential disqualification):**
1. 10+ years sales experience (railcar leasing OR equivalent industry experience)
2. Demonstrated revenue growth and account management success
3. Ability to travel 75%
4. Excellent communication skills

**Industry Experience Consideration:**
This role EXPLICITLY requires "10+ years of experience in rail car leasing and sales." Candidates without direct railcar leasing experience should be scored with appropriate deductions in:
- Technical Skills (Required): Cannot score Expert without railcar-specific experience
- Industry/Domain Experience: Maximum score of 5-6 without direct industry experience
- Primary Duties: May lack industry relationships critical for customer development

## Role-Specific Considerations

### Industry Context
- Railcar leasing is a specialized, relationship-driven industry with long sales cycles

- AITX is mid-market player competing with GATX, Trinity Industries, Union Tank Car
- Key commodities: petroleum, chemicals, agriculture, food, plastics

### Transferability Assessment
Candidates from adjacent industries should be evaluated on:
1. **Most Transferable**: Equipment leasing (trucks, containers, aircraft), industrial equipment sales
2. **Moderately Transferable**: Transportation/logistics sales, industrial B2B sales
3. **Least Transferable**: General B2B sales, retail, consumer products

### Red Flags
- No leasing or equipment finance experience
- Purely inside sales without territory ownership
- No customer relationship management experience
- Unable to demonstrate travel flexibility for 75% travel requirement
- No cross-functional collaboration experience
