### Overall Score Ranges:
- **90-100**: Exceptional candidate - exceeds requirements significantly, ideal background with institutional real estate leadership, P3 experience, proven track record of complex deal execution and value creation
- **80-89**: Excellent candidate - strong match with deep real estate expertise, solid P3/partnership experience, proven strategic leadership, minor gaps in institutional context or innovation park experience
- **70-79**: Good candidate - solid real estate background with relevant skills, some P3 or partnership exposure, capable strategic thinker, development areas include institutional experience or municipal navigation complexity
- **60-69**: Potential candidate - meets core real estate requirements but notable gaps in P3 partnerships, institutional context, or strategic leadership at required level, consider if high learning potential and cultural fit
- **50-59**: Borderline candidate - significant gaps in critical areas (P3 experience, institutional background, or senior strategic leadership), requires substantial development, consider only if exceptional in specific high-priority areas
- **Below 50**: Not recommended - major gaps in critical competencies including strategic acquisitions, P3 partnerships, stakeholder management at required complexity, or leadership at AVP level

## Usage Guidelines

### When Scoring:
1. Review job description thoroughly before scoring - focus on "deep experience in strategic real estate acquisition, development, and partnerships, preferably gained through deals with institutional or public-sector environments"
2. Map each requirement to candidate's experience with specific evidence from CV
3. Look for evidence, not assumptions - distinguish between direct experience, adjacent experience, and transferable skills
4. Consider recency of experience (weight recent institutional/strategic work more heavily than dated operational roles)
5. Account for career progression and growth trajectory toward strategic leadership

### Critical Factors for McMaster AVP Role:
- P3 partnership structuring and negotiation experience is highly valuable - lack of this is significant gap
- Institutional or public-sector real estate context is strongly preferred - purely private sector background may struggle with university environment
- Strategic leadership at VP/AVP level reporting to C-suite is critical - operational roles insufficient
- Revenue generation track record is essential - must demonstrate financial value creation
- Any "must-have" requirement (strategic acquisitions, development experience, stakeholder management) scored below 2 may disqualify
- Innovation Park experience is rare and valuable - strong plus factor

### Documentation:
- Note specific CV line numbers and examples supporting each score
- Document concerns or areas needing clarification in interview
- Identify questions for interview follow-up on P3 experience, institutional context, Innovation Park familiarity
- Record any special circumstances or context affecting scoring
- Distinguish between claimed experience and verifiable evidence with metrics

## Role-Specific Considerations for McMaster AVP Real Estate

### Market Context:
- Canadian university real estate market increasingly focused on P3 partnerships for student housing, research facilities, mixed-use developments
- McMaster Innovation Park represents significant strategic asset requiring specialized management bridging commercial and academic objectives
- Hamilton, Ontario market dynamics: growing innovation district, proximity to Toronto GTA, municipal planning complexities
- Growing importance of real estate as revenue source for universities facing funding constraints

### Competitive Landscape:
- Limited talent pool with combination of institutional real estate + P3 partnership + strategic leadership experience
- May need to consider candidates from adjacent institutional sectors (hospitals, government agencies) or large developers with P3 focus
- Strong commercial real estate leaders may lack public sector sensitivity and stakeholder management skills
- Public sector leaders may lack deal structuring sophistication and revenue generation orientation

### Success Factors:
- Ability to balance university mission (academic, research, community) with financial objectives
- Credibility with both internal academic stakeholders and external developer/government partners
- Strategic thinking to identify non-obvious opportunities for value creation
- Political acumen to navigate university governance and community sensitivities
- Entrepreneurial mindset within institutional constraints

### Key Interview Focus Areas:
- Specific P3 deal examples: structure, parties, challenges, outcomes, role
- Stakeholder management on controversial projects: approach, conflicts, resolution strategies
- Revenue generation achievements: specific numbers, mechanisms, sustainability
- Strategic thinking process: how they identify opportunities, evaluate alternatives, make recommendations
- Cultural fit with academic mission: examples balancing financial and non-financial objectives
- Innovation Park understanding: research commercialization, entrepreneurship ecosystems, tenant mix strategies

### Risk Factors to Probe:
- Private sector candidates: Can they adapt to academic pace, consensus culture, mission-driven priorities?
- Public sector candidates: Do they have deal sophistication, revenue orientation, competitive market instincts?
- Strong operators: Can they think strategically vs just execute on identified opportunities?
- Deal-makers: Can they build lasting partnerships vs transactional one-off deals?
- Local market knowledge: Understanding of Hamilton, GTA, Ontario municipal processes vs generic experience

### Unique Aspects of This Role:
- Dual mandate: revenue generation AND academic/research mission support
- High visibility: reporting to VP Operations & Finance, presenting to President/VPs
- Strategic impact: shaping university's long-term financial sustainability and real estate footprint
- Complex stakeholder environment: academic departments, students, community, government, developers
- Innovation Park stewardship: managing existing complex asset while expanding partnerships
- Long-term orientation: building sustainable revenue streams and partnerships vs short-term deals
- Reputational sensitivity: university brand considerations in all transactions
