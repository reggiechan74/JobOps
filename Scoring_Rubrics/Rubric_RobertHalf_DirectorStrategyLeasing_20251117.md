- **Below 50**: Not recommended - major gaps in multiple critical areas; does not meet role requirements

## Usage Guidelines

### When Using This Rubric:
1. **Review job posting thoroughly** before scoring candidate against each criterion
2. **Map systematically** - assess each technical skill, responsibility, and requirement independently
3. **Demand evidence** - score based on documented experience, not assumptions or inferences
4. **Weight recency** - prioritize recent experience (last 5 years) over older experience; apply evidence verification framework
5. **Consider trajectory** - account for career progression, growth, and learning velocity
6. **Apply domain rigor** - distinguish between direct, adjacent, transferable, and assumed experience per evidence verification framework

### Critical Factors:
- **Must-have requirements**: Commercial lease negotiation experience (≥2/3), Portfolio management experience (≥2/3), Real Estate financial analysis (≥2/3) are baseline; scoring below these thresholds significantly weakens candidacy
- **Minimum category thresholds**: Technical Skills ≥18/25, Relevant Experience ≥18/25, Key Responsibilities ≥14/20 recommended for strong candidacy
- **Portfolio scope**: National or multi-regional scope strongly preferred; single-market experience is significant gap
- **Leadership**: People management or extensive cross-functional leadership required for cultural fit (≥2/5)

### Documentation:
- **Cite specific examples** supporting each score with CV line references
- **Document concerns** - note any areas needing interview clarification or reference check validation
- **Identify interview questions** - flag areas where evidence is thin or claims need verification
- **Record context** - note special circumstances, unique experiences, or mitigating factors

## CRITICAL: EVIDENCE-BASED SCORING VERIFICATION

**MANDATORY APPLICATION** - Before finalizing any score, apply the evidence verification framework:

### Evidence Citation Requirement
For every score ≥2 points:
- Quote specific CV text supporting the score
- Identify exact CV section/line numbers from candidate profile JSON
- Distinguish between direct experience vs transferable skills
- Verify experience duration and recency

### Domain Specificity Verification
NEVER assume domain equivalency:
- Different industries require different expertise (corporate RE ≠ REIT ≠ property management ≠ facilities)
- Different functions require different skills (leasing ≠ acquisitions ≠ development ≠ valuation)
- Different company sizes require different capabilities (startup ≠ enterprise ≠ mid-market)

### Experience Type Classification
Before scoring, classify as:
- **Direct**: Exact same role/industry/function as requirement
- **Adjacent**: Related but different (specify differences clearly)
- **Transferable**: Different but applicable skills (justify transfer logic rigorously)
- **Assumed**: No explicit evidence (score as "None" or maximum "Basic")

### Quality Control Checklist
□ Every score ≥2 has specific CV citation with line numbers from candidate profile
□ Domain/industry experience explicitly verified (not inferred from titles)
□ Years of experience match claimed specialization level
□ Leadership scope verified vs assumed based on title
□ Technical skills backed by specific project examples with outcomes
□ Achievement metrics directly quoted from CV with timeframes
□ No conflation of different industries/functions/company types

## Role-Specific Considerations

### Market Context (Canada Commercial Real Estate - Late 2025)
- **Office Market**: Post-pandemic hybrid work driving office portfolio optimization; tenants seeking flexibility and smaller footprints; landlords offering concessions
- **Industrial Market**: Continued strong demand for logistics/warehouse space; rental growth moderating from 2021-2022 peaks; build-to-suit and expansion activity
- **Competitive Talent Landscape**: Senior real estate strategists with national multi-site experience are in demand; proven lease negotiation and portfolio optimization skills command premium
- **Regulatory Environment**: Lease accounting (IFRS 16/ASC 842) compliance critical; ESG and sustainability considerations increasingly important in site selection

### Success Factors for This Role
1. **Strategic mindset** - ability to think beyond individual transactions to portfolio-level optimization
2. **Executive presence** - comfort and credibility presenting to C-suite and board
3. **Financial acumen** - sophisticated understanding of real estate economics and deal structuring
4. **Relationship builder** - proven ability to cultivate productive relationships with landlords, brokers, internal partners
5. **Change agent** - demonstrated track record improving processes, implementing systems, driving efficiency

### Red Flags to Watch
- Purely transactional background without strategic portfolio experience
- Limited or no lease negotiation experience (support role only)
- Single-market or single-site experience without multi-location exposure
- No cross-functional leadership or stakeholder management examples
- Lack of measurable achievements or quantified outcomes
- No professional development or credential pursuit in field
- Poor cultural fit indicators (individual contributor preference, resistance to collaboration)
