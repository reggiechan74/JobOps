## Scoring Guidelines

### Overall Score Ranges:
- **90-100**: Exceptional candidate - exceeds requirements significantly across creative leadership, studio operations, and cultural fit

- **70-79**: Good candidate - solid match with relevant experience, some development areas in specific skills or scope
- **60-69**: Potential candidate - meets core requirements, notable gaps in studio management or creative leadership
- **50-59**: Borderline candidate - significant gaps in critical areas, consider if high potential and willing to develop
- **Below 50**: Not recommended - major gaps in creative leadership, traffic management, or required technical skills

## Usage Guidelines

### When Scoring:
1. Review job description thoroughly before scoring - this is a HYBRID role requiring both creative vision AND operational excellence
2. Map each requirement to candidate's experience with specific evidence from CV (line numbers)
3. Look for evidence, not assumptions - distinguish between direct experience vs transferable skills
4. Consider recency of experience (weight last 5 years most heavily)
5. Account for career progression and growth trajectory toward leadership

### Critical Factors:
- **Must-Have "Creative Leadership" (Section 1)** scored below 2 points = major concern
- **Must-Have "Project/Traffic Management" (Section 1)** scored below 2 points = major concern
- **Must-Have "Studio Workflow Management" (Section 3)** scored below 2 points = major concern
- Candidate must demonstrate BOTH creative excellence AND operational capabilities - not just one
- Consider minimum acceptable scores: Section 1 ≥18, Section 2 ≥15, Section 3 ≥12

### Documentation:
- Note specific CV examples supporting each score with line numbers
- Document concerns or areas needing clarification for interview
- Identify questions for interview follow-up on hybrid creative + operations role
- Record any special circumstances or context (e.g., career transitions, industry changes)

## Role-Specific Considerations

### Unique Aspects of This Role:
1. **Hybrid Creative + Operations**: This role uniquely blends Art Director-level creative vision with Traffic Manager-level operational excellence. Candidate must demonstrate strength in BOTH areas, not just one.

2. **Insurance Industry Context**: While industry experience not required, candidate must demonstrate ability to work in regulated, brand-sensitive environment (financial services, professional services, healthcare all relevant).

3. **In-House Studio vs Agency**: In-house studio roles differ from agency - longer-term brand stewardship, internal stakeholder management, sustainable workflow vs. sprint-based agency cycles. Evaluate candidate's fit for in-house environment.

4. **Studio Leadership Scope**: Leading in-house team + external partners in high-volume environment (15+ projects/month) requires strong organizational skills and calm under pressure. Assess evidence of thriving in fast-paced, high-volume creative operations.

5. **Cultural Fit Critical**: Definity emphasizes collaborative, empowering, inclusive culture. Evidence of DEI leadership (e.g., ERG involvement) is strong positive signal. Autocratic or siloed working style would be poor fit.

6. **Tools Requirements**: Asana proficiency specifically called out - assess current tool use and learning agility. Adobe Creative Suite and Figma are table stakes.

7. **Portfolio Assessment**: Request portfolio as critical component of evaluation - look for evidence of creative leadership across channels, brand consistency, and integrated campaign thinking.

### Market Context (2025):
- Creative manager roles in Canada typically require 6-10 years experience for mid-to-senior level positions
- Salary range $77-142K CAD aligns with Canadian market for Manager-level creative roles in corporate/insurance sector (mid-range: ~$100-110K)
- Hybrid creative + operations roles are increasingly common as companies seek efficiency in creative operations
- Asana is industry-standard PM tool for creative teams in 2025 (replacing older tools like Workfront in many organizations)
- Insurance sector creative roles require brand sensitivity and understanding of regulatory constraints on marketing claims

### Red Flags to Watch For:
- Primarily freelance or agency background with no in-house experience (may struggle with internal stakeholder dynamics)
- Strong creative portfolio but no evidence of workflow management or operations (missing critical hybrid requirement)
- Strong PM background but weak creative credentials (won't earn respect of design team)
- Job-hopping pattern in recent years (need stability for studio leadership role)
- No people management experience (managing team is core requirement)
- Inability to demonstrate balancing creative excellence with business constraints (will struggle with corporate environment)
