## WEIGHT VARIANT SELECTION

### Selected Variant: Technical IC

| Justification Factor | Evidence from Job Posting |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Primary Role Function | "Develop and implement all leasing activities for a given portfolio of properties" — hands-on execution |
| Reporting Structure | Reports to Senior Director, Leasing — no direct reports mentioned |
| Success Metrics Type | Leasing performance metrics (NER, budgets, deal execution) — technical deliverables |
| Decision Authority Level | Individual deal-level authority with team coordination — not team management |

**Rationale:** No direct reports mentioned. Role is described as an individual who will "work collaboratively" with teams. All responsibilities are execution-focused (negotiate leases, run financial analysis, develop marketing plans) rather than team management. Title "Director" in CRE leasing context denotes senior practitioner.
