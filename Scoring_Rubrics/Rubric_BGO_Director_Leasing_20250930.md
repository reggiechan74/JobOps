## Usage Guidelines

### When Scoring:
1. **Evidence-Based Assessment**: Map each requirement to specific candidate evidence from CV with line number citations
2. **Recency Weighting**: Weight recent experience (within 5 years) more heavily than older experience
3. **Career Trajectory**: Consider progression and growth trajectory, not just current/most recent role
4. **Distinguish Experience Types**: Clearly identify Direct (exact match), Adjacent (related but different), Transferable (different but applicable), vs Assumed (no explicit evidence)
5. **Challenge High Scores**: For any score ≥3 points, ask "Where exactly is the evidence?" and verify with CV citations
6. **Quantitative Verification**: All metrics-based scoring must have explicit CV support with numbers, timeframes, mechanisms
7. **Domain Specificity**: Never assume equivalency across industries/functions/company types without explicit evidence

### Critical Factors:
- **Must-Have Requirements**: Any "must-have" scored below 2 points requires strong justification if recommending candidate
- **Deal Breakers**: Missing RECO license (without path to obtain), <5 years industrial leasing, no GTA presence are automatic disqualifiers
- **Red Flags**: Significant gaps in technical skills (score <10/25), experience (score <12/25), or responsibilities (score <8/20) indicate high risk
- **Cultural Fit**: Score below 3/5 on cultural fit requires interview validation before proceeding

### Documentation:
- **Evidence Citations**: Note specific CV examples with line numbers supporting each score
- **Gaps & Concerns**: Document all concerns, missing evidence, assumptions, and areas needing interview clarification
- **Questions for Interview**: Record specific questions to validate experiences, probe gaps, and assess cultural fit
- **Special Circumstances**: Note any unique context, extenuating circumstances, or compensating factors
- **Reference Check Focus**: Identify specific areas requiring reference validation
