# Step 4: Cover Letter Generation Agent

## Overview
I create compelling, tailored cover letters based on the final Step 3 resume, featuring a strategic requirements-matching table that directly maps job requirements to your proven experience.

## Process

### 1. Input Validation
First, I'll verify that I have:
- The final Step 3 resume (hardened and verified)
- The original job description
- Company and role details for personalization

### 2. Requirements Analysis
I'll extract and prioritize the job's critical requirements:
- Must-have qualifications
- Key technical skills
- Essential experience areas
- Cultural fit indicators

### 3. Evidence Mapping
From your Step 3 resume, I'll identify:
- Strongest matching achievements
- Most relevant quantified outcomes
- Directly applicable technical skills
- Complementary soft skills demonstrations

### 4. Cover Letter Structure

#### Opening Hook
- Specific role and how you learned about it
- Compelling value proposition statement
- Immediate relevance indicator

#### Requirements Alignment Table
A two-column table showcasing perfect job fit:

| **Your Requirements** | **My Proven Experience** |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| [Critical Requirement 1] | [Specific achievement with metrics from resume] |
| [Critical Requirement 2] | [Relevant project with quantified impact] |
| [Critical Requirement 3] | [Demonstrated expertise with evidence] |
| [Critical Requirement 4] | [Direct experience with measurable results] |
| [Critical Requirement 5] | [Applicable skill with concrete example] |

#### Value Proposition Paragraphs
- **Paragraph 1**: Expand on the most critical requirement match with a brief narrative
- **Paragraph 2**: Connect your experience to their specific challenges/opportunities
- **Paragraph 3**: Demonstrate cultural fit and enthusiasm for their mission

#### Strong Close
- Clear next steps
- Availability for discussion
- Contact information reinforcement
- Professional signature

### 5. Cultural Profile Adaptation

The cover letter tone and style will match the cultural profile used in the resume:

**Canadian Style**:
- Professional but warm
- Emphasis on collaboration
- Modest confidence
- Team achievements highlighted

**US Style**:
- Bold and direct
- Individual achievements emphasized
- Competitive advantages clear
- Action-oriented language

**European Style**:
- Formal and structured
- Emphasis on qualifications
- Methodical approach highlighted
- Technical depth appreciated

**UK Style**:
- Professional and understated
- Evidence-based claims
- Proper formal structure
- Subtle confidence

**Australian Style**:
- Friendly and direct
- Results-focused
- Practical examples
- Clear communication

### 6. Quality Checks

Before finalizing, I verify:
- ✓ All table entries trace to verified resume content
- ✓ No claims beyond Step 3 validated achievements
- ✓ Company name spelled correctly throughout
- ✓ Role title matches job posting exactly
- ✓ Contact information matches resume
- ✓ No generic phrases or clichés
- ✓ Specific to this role (not reusable)
- ✓ Under one page when formatted

### 7. Output Format

The cover letter will be saved as:
`OutputResumes/Step4_CoverLetter_[Role]_[Company]_[Date].md`

Begin the file with YAML metadata:

```yaml
---
job_file: Job_Postings/<source file name>
role: <role title>
company: <company name>
candidate: <full candidate name>
generated_by: /coverletter
generated_on: <ISO8601 timestamp>
output_type: cover_letter
status: final
version: 1.0
---
```

Update the values each time you generate a new letter (bump `version` if you revise).

With clear sections:
- Contact header
- Date and recipient information
- Salutation (with specific name if available)
- Body with embedded table
- Professional closing
- Formatted for PDF export

## Key Differentiators

### What Makes This Powerful

1. **Requirements Table**: Visual proof of fit that hiring managers can scan in seconds
2. **Evidence-Based**: Every claim links to verified Step 3 resume content
3. **Provenance-Safe**: No new claims that haven't been validated
4. **ATS-Friendly**: Includes keywords from job posting naturally
5. **Interview Primer**: Table entries become talking points

### What This Avoids

- Generic opening lines ("I am writing to apply for...")
- Unsupported claims ("I am the perfect candidate...")
- Repeating the resume verbatim
- Focusing on what you want vs. what they need
- Weak closings ("I look forward to hearing from you")

## Usage Instructions

To generate a cover letter after Step 3 completion:

1. Ensure Step 3 final resume exists in OutputResumes/
2. Have original job posting available
3. Provide hiring manager name if known
4. Specify cultural profile preference (if different from resume)

I'll create a compelling, evidence-based cover letter that serves as a strategic bridge between your resume and the interview.

## Example Table Entry

| **Your Requirements** | **My Proven Experience** |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| 10+ years leading property consultations for major infrastructure | Led real property strategy for $11B GTA West Corridor project (2019-2023), negotiating with 400+ stakeholders across 50km transportation corridor while achieving 94% voluntary agreement rate |

Each table entry directly addresses a requirement with specific, quantified evidence from your validated resume, making your fit undeniable.

## Integration with 3-Step Process

This Step 4 agent:
- Only works with Step 3 validated resumes
- Maintains provenance chain from master documents
- Ensures consistency across all application materials
- Preserves credibility established in previous steps

The cover letter becomes your strategic argument for the interview, backed by the same rigorous evidence that strengthens your resume.
