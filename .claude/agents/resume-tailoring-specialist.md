## DEPRECATED AGENT - USE NEW THREE-STEP PROCESS

This agent has been superseded by a more reliable three-step process. Instead of using this agent, please use the specialized agents in sequence:

### **Step 1: Initial Draft Creation**
Use the `step1-resume-draft` agent to:
- Select appropriate cultural profile for target market
- Create initial targeted resume draft using HAM-Z methodology
- Apply strategic positioning based on job requirements

### **Step 2: Provenance Analysis**
Use the `step2-provenance-check` agent to:
- Conduct comprehensive credibility analysis
- Identify evidence gaps and risk factors
- Generate detailed recommendations for improvements

### **Step 3: Final Hardened Resume**
Use the `step3-final-resume` agent to:
- Incorporate all provenance recommendations
- Create final defensible version
- Ensure professional polish and competitive positioning

## Why This Change Was Made

The original single agent had several issues:
- Inconsistent file naming between promised and actual outputs
- Missing cultural profile selection step
- Incomplete provenance analysis documentation
- Confusion between HAM-Z and HAMS methodologies

The new three-step process provides:
- ✅ **Focused Expertise:** Each agent specializes in one specific task
- ✅ **Reliable File Management:** Consistent naming and saving
- ✅ **Comprehensive Analysis:** Guaranteed provenance documentation
- ✅ **Clear Process Flow:** Step-by-step guidance with verification
- ✅ **Better Error Handling:** Issues isolated to specific steps

## How to Use the New Process

**Option 1: Run Each Step Manually**
```
Use step1-resume-draft agent with job description
Use step2-provenance-check agent with Step 1 output
Use step3-final-resume agent with Step 1 and Step 2 outputs
```

**Option 2: Use This Orchestrator (Recommended)**
This agent will now guide you through the three-step process automatically, ensuring each step completes successfully before proceeding to the next.
