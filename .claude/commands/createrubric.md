description: Create a detailed scoring rubric from job posting without performing assessment
signature: "<job-posting-file>"
project: true
---

You are acting as an expert HR recruiter and domain-knowledgeable hiring manager. Create a comprehensive, job-specific scoring rubric from the specified job posting that can be used for consistent candidate evaluation.

## Your Task

Analyze the {{ARG1}} job posting and generate a detailed, reusable scoring rubric that extracts all requirements and creates standardized evaluation criteria.

## Step-by-Step Process

### YAML front matter for rubric output
Write the rubric to `Scoring_Rubrics/Rubric_*` and begin the file with:

```yaml
---
job_file: Job_Postings/{{ARG1}}
role: <role title>
company: <company name>
generated_by: /createrubric
generated_on: <ISO8601 timestamp>
output_type: rubric
status: final
version: 1.0
---
```

Insert this before the first heading and bump `version` if you update the rubric later.

### 1. Load Job Posting
- Read the job posting from `Job_Postings/{{ARG1}}` (add .md extension if needed)
- If the file doesn't exist in Job_Postings/, check the root directory for legacy files

### 2. Acquire Domain Knowledge
Use web research to understand:
- Industry standards and role expectations for the specific position
- Required vs nice-to-have skills based on current market standards
- Typical responsibilities and seniority indicators in this domain
- Company context, culture, technology stack, and recent developments
- Current market conditions, salary ranges, and competitive landscape
- Industry-specific terminology and best practices

### 3. Create Dynamic Job-Specific Rubric

Analyze the job posting to extract and categorize requirements, then create a customized scoring rubric.

**ðŸš¨ MANDATORY DETAILED SCORING REQUIREMENT ðŸš¨**
The dynamic rubric you create MUST include granular point allocation for every single criterion. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. You cannot create simplified rubrics or skip detailed breakdowns. Every skill, every experience level, every responsibility MUST have the complete 4-level or 5-level scoring framework with specific, measurable criteria.

#### Parse Job Posting to Identify:
- **Required Technical Skills**: List all must-have technical competencies
- **Preferred Skills**: List nice-to-have skills and technologies
- **Experience Requirements**: Years, industry, domain specifics
- **Key Responsibilities**: Primary duties and scope expectations
- **Education/Certifications**: Required and preferred credentials
- **Soft Skills/Cultural Fit**: Communication, collaboration, values

#### Generate Custom Rubric Structure:
Create a job-specific rubric following this template with MANDATORY detailed scoring breakdowns.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: You MUST include the complete detailed scoring breakdown (Expert/Proficient/Basic/None) for EVERY SINGLE skill and criteria. Do NOT create simplified versions. Do NOT skip the granular point allocation. The rubric MUST be as detailed as the template below - no shortcuts allowed.

**ENFORCEMENT CHECK**: After creating the rubric, verify that EVERY section includes:
- Individual skill breakdowns with 4-level scoring (Expert/Proficient/Basic/None)
- Specific measurable criteria for each level
- Overall assessment ranges
- Complete evaluation frameworks for scope & complexity
- Detailed scoring breakdowns for achievements & impact

**FAILURE TO INCLUDE DETAILED BREAKDOWNS VIOLATES THE COMMAND REQUIREMENTS**

- **70-79**: Good candidate - solid match, some development areas
- **60-69**: Potential candidate - meets core requirements, notable gaps
- **50-59**: Borderline candidate - significant gaps, consider if high potential
- **Below 50**: Not recommended - major gaps in critical areas

## Usage Guidelines

### When Using This Rubric:
1. Review job description thoroughly before scoring any candidate
2. Map each requirement to candidate's experience systematically
3. Look for evidence, not assumptions
4. Consider recency of experience (weight recent more heavily)
5. Account for career progression and growth trajectory

## CRITICAL: EVIDENCE-BASED SCORING VERIFICATION FOR RUBRIC USERS

When applying this rubric to assess candidates:

### 1. Evidence Citation Requirement
For every score above "Basic" (1 point), you MUST:
- Quote specific CV text supporting the score
- Identify exact CV section/line numbers
- Distinguish between direct experience vs transferable skills
- Verify claimed experience duration and recency

### 2. Domain Specificity Verification
NEVER assume domain equivalency without explicit evidence:
- Different industries require different expertise (healthcare â‰  finance â‰  retail â‰  manufacturing)
- Different functions require different skills (sales â‰  operations â‰  engineering â‰  marketing)
- Different company sizes require different capabilities (startup â‰  enterprise â‰  mid-market)
- Different asset/product types require specialized knowledge

### 3. Experience Type Classification
Before scoring, verify and classify experience as:
- **Direct**: Exact same role/industry/function as job requirement
- **Adjacent**: Related but different (specify differences)
- **Transferable**: Different but applicable skills (justify transfer logic)
- **Assumed**: No explicit evidence (score as "None" or "Basic" only)

### 4. Cross-Reference Protocol
Before scoring each section:
- Ask: "Where exactly in the CV does this evidence appear?"
- Verify: Does the evidence match the specific skill/experience requirement?
- Challenge: What evidence contradicts a high score?
- Validate: Are years of experience consistent with claimed expertise level?

### 5. Quality Control Checklist
â–¡ Every score â‰¥2 has specific CV citation with line numbers
â–¡ Domain/industry experience explicitly verified (not inferred)
â–¡ Years of experience match claimed specialization level
â–¡ Leadership scope verified vs assumed
â–¡ Technical skills backed by specific project examples
â–¡ Achievement metrics directly quoted from CV
â–¡ No conflation of different industries/functions/company types

### 6. Scoring Revision Protocol
If evidence doesn't support initial score:
- Immediately revise score downward to match actual evidence
- Document the correction reasoning in assessment notes
- Recalculate total score and recommendation level
- Update executive summary to reflect corrected analysis

### Critical Factors:
- Any "must-have" requirement scored below 3 may disqualify
- Consider minimum acceptable scores for each category
- Weight sections differently based on role priorities

### Documentation:
- Note specific examples supporting each score
- Document concerns or areas needing clarification
- Identify questions for interview follow-up
- Record any special circumstances or context

## Role-Specific Considerations
**MANDATORY: Add specific considerations based on job posting analysis**
[Add any unique aspects of this particular role, market conditions, competitive landscape, etc.]
```

### 4. Quality Control and Verification

**MANDATORY QUALITY CHECK**: Before saving, verify the rubric includes ALL required detailed breakdowns:
- âœ… Every required skill has Expert/Proficient/Basic/None scoring with specific criteria
- âœ… Every preferred skill has Strong/Basic/None scoring with role-specific thresholds
- âœ… Experience sections have 5-level detailed scoring breakdowns
- âœ… Primary duties have Expert/Proficient/Basic/None frameworks
- âœ… Scope & complexity has detailed evaluation framework with specific metrics
- âœ… Achievements & impact has 5-level scoring with quantitative thresholds
- âœ… Education & certifications have detailed multi-level scoring
- âœ… Cultural fit has comprehensive evaluation criteria and scoring levels

**IF ANY SECTION LACKS DETAILED BREAKDOWNS, THE RUBRIC IS INCOMPLETE AND MUST BE REGENERATED**

### 5. Save the Rubric

Save the generated rubric to: `Scoring_Rubrics/Rubric_[Company]_[Role]_[Date].md`

Provide a summary of:
- Total skills/requirements identified
- Key differentiators for this role
- Notable industry-specific requirements
- Recommended usage guidelines

## Important Notes

- **MANDATORY DETAILED SCORING**: Every rubric MUST include the granular scoring breakdowns from the framework rubric. This is not optional - it is required.
- **Dynamic Rubric Creation**: Each job posting generates its own tailored rubric with job-specific criteria but framework-level detail
- **Complete Scoring Levels**: All sections must include the detailed point breakdowns (Expert/Proficient/Basic, Exceptional/Strong/Good, etc.)
- **Role-Specific Adaptation**: Customize the content and thresholds for the specific role while maintaining scoring structure depth
- **Consistency**: Use the embedded framework as the foundation but customize content to job requirements
- **Domain Research**: Use web research to understand industry-specific requirements and adapt scoring thresholds accordingly
- **Documentation**: Save rubric for reuse across multiple candidates for the same position
- **Quality Control**: The generated rubric must be as detailed as the framework rubric - no shortcuts or simplified versions allowed

## ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES ðŸ”¥

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS FOR EVERY RUBRIC:**
1. **EVERY REQUIRED SKILL** must have Expert (3) / Proficient (2) / Basic (1) / None (0) with specific criteria
2. **EVERY PREFERRED SKILL** must have Strong (2) / Basic (1) / None (0) with role-specific thresholds
3. **EXPERIENCE SECTIONS** must have 5-level detailed breakdowns (Exceeds/Meets Plus/Meets/Near/Below)
4. **PRIMARY DUTIES** must have Expert/Proficient/Basic/None with quantitative thresholds
5. **SCOPE & COMPLEXITY** must include detailed evaluation framework with specific metrics
6. **ACHIEVEMENTS** must have 5-level scoring with quantitative thresholds (revenue, portfolio size, etc.)
7. **EDUCATION & CERTIFICATIONS** must have multi-level detailed scoring
8. **CULTURAL FIT** must have comprehensive evaluation criteria

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:**
- Any rubric missing detailed breakdowns is INCOMPLETE and violates the command specification
- You must regenerate the rubric if any section lacks granular scoring
- Simplified or abbreviated rubrics are NOT ACCEPTABLE
- The rubric must be as detailed as the embedded template - no exceptions

**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST - BEFORE SAVING ANY RUBRIC:**
â–¡ Every skill has 4-level scoring with specific, measurable criteria
â–¡ Every section includes detailed point allocation breakdowns
â–¡ All evaluation frameworks include quantitative thresholds
â–¡ Overall assessment ranges are provided for each section
â–¡ Role-specific criteria are adapted from the template structure
