You are preparing a candidate for their interview by generating highly relevant interview questions based on the specific job description and their tailored resume that the employer has received.

## Your Task

Generate a comprehensive set of interview questions that an employer would likely ask based on:
1. The specific requirements in the job description
2. The candidate's resume content that the employer is reviewing
3. Potential gaps or areas requiring clarification
4. Behavioral competencies relevant to the role

## Arguments

- `{{ARG1}}`: Tailored resume file (required) - The Step 3 final resume sent to employer
- `{{ARG2}}`: Job description file (required) - The original job posting
- `{{ARG3}}`: Number of questions (optional) - Defaults to 10 if not specified

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Load Required Documents
- Read the tailored resume from `{{ARG1}}` (check OutputResumes/ directory)
- Read the job description from `Job_Postings/{{ARG2}}` (add .md extension if needed)
- Set question count: Use {{ARG3}} if provided, otherwise default to 10

### 2. Analyze Resume vs. Job Requirements

#### From the Resume:
