description: Perform expert HR assessment of candidate against job posting with domain knowledge
signature: "<job-posting-file>"
project: true
---

You are acting as both an expert HR recruiter and a domain-knowledgeable hiring manager. Perform a comprehensive assessment of the candidate's work history against the specified job posting.

## Your Task

Create a job-specific scoring rubric from the {{ARG1}} job posting, then evaluate the candidate using this customized rubric to provide a detailed assessment report.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Load Required Documents
- Read the job posting from `Job_Postings/{{ARG1}}` (add .md extension if needed)
- Load ALL candidate work history files from `ResumeSourceFolder/` directory:
  - Use glob pattern to find all markdown files in ResumeSourceFolder/
  - Read each file to build complete candidate profile
  - Include all CV, resume, technology capability, and work history documents

### 2. Create Dynamic Job-Specific Rubric
Analyze the job posting to extract and categorize requirements, then create a customized scoring rubric.

**ðŸš¨ MANDATORY DETAILED SCORING REQUIREMENT ðŸš¨**
The dynamic rubric you create MUST include granular point allocation for every single criterion. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. You cannot create simplified rubrics or skip detailed breakdowns. Every skill, every experience level, every responsibility MUST have the complete 4-level or 5-level scoring framework with specific, measurable criteria.

#### Parse Job Posting to Identify:
- **Required Technical Skills**: List all must-have technical competencies
- **Preferred Skills**: List nice-to-have skills and technologies
- **Experience Requirements**: Years, industry, domain specifics
- **Key Responsibilities**: Primary duties and scope expectations
- **Education/Certifications**: Required and preferred credentials
- **Soft Skills/Cultural Fit**: Communication, collaboration, values

#### Generate Custom Rubric Structure:
Create a job-specific rubric following this template with MANDATORY detailed scoring breakdowns.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: You MUST include the complete detailed scoring breakdown (Expert/Proficient/Basic/None) for EVERY SINGLE skill and criteria. Do NOT create simplified versions. Do NOT skip the granular point allocation. The rubric MUST be as detailed as the template below - no shortcuts allowed.

**ENFORCEMENT CHECK**: After creating the rubric, verify that EVERY section includes:
- Individual skill breakdowns with 4-level scoring (Expert/Proficient/Basic/None)
- Specific measurable criteria for each level
- Overall assessment ranges
- Complete evaluation frameworks for scope & complexity
- Detailed scoring breakdowns for achievements & impact

**FAILURE TO INCLUDE DETAILED BREAKDOWNS VIOLATES THE COMMAND REQUIREMENTS**
