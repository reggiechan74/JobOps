### Best Practices

1. **Ask One Phase at a Time**: Don't overwhelm with all questions at once
2. **Provide Examples**: Use generic examples to clarify expectations
3. **Offer Options**: When possible, give multiple choice options
4. **Confirm Understanding**: Summarize answers before moving to next phase
5. **Allow Iteration**: Let user revise answers before finalizing

### Opening Script

Begin with:

> "I'll help you create a comprehensive copywriting specification for [Company Name]. This document will define your brand voice, tone, and language guidelines for all communications.

> 3. Voice & Tone
> 4. Language Guidelines
> 5. Messaging Hierarchy
> 6. Proof Points
> 7. Competitor Differentiation
> 8. Channel Requirements
>
> Let's start with Brand Identity..."

### Closing Script

After generating the document:

> "I've created your copywriting specification at `[file path]`.
>
> **Recommended Next Steps:**
> 1. Review the document for accuracy
> 2. Fill in any `[TO BE COMPLETED]` sections
> 3. Share with stakeholders for feedback
> 4. Use `/landing-page:create` to build pages following this spec
>
> Would you like me to review or refine any section?"

## Quick Start Mode

If the user provides substantial information upfront (e.g., existing brand guidelines, website content, or detailed brief), skip redundant questions and proceed directly to generation, asking only for clarification on gaps.

To detect quick start eligibility, check if the user provides:
- Company name and positioning
- Target audience description
- At least 3 proof points with context
- Tone/voice preferences

If all four are present, proceed to generation with targeted clarifying questions only.
