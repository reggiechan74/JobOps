# Maintenance checklist

Use this checklist whenever you add new roles, certifications, or technology updates.

- [ ] Duplicate the latest comprehensive files into `_Archive/` with the current date.
- [ ] Create or update the relevant template copy in `Experience/`, `CareerHighlights/`, or `Technology/` with YAML front matter.
- [ ] Update `Guides/Migration_Tracker.md` with every new or modified section until verified.
- [ ] Cross-link new content back to `[[Comprehensive CV MASTER COPY v36]]` and any related experience or technology anchors.
- [ ] Refresh `lastUpdated` dates and tags in the front matter.
- [ ] Append a note in the `Revision history` section of the master overview summarizing changes.
- [ ] Review Obsidian Dataview or search queries to confirm new tags work as expected.
- [ ] Mark completed rows in the tracker as `Verified` once content is proofed and the archive comparison is complete.
