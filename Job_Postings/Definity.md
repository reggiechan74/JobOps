Our ambition is to be one of Canada’s leading and most innovative property and casualty insurers. We can’t do that without our people, so we embrace and encourage a culture that’s collaborative, ambitious, rewarding, and empowering.

Definity Insurance is seeking a Manager, Creative & Design to head our in-house creative studio—a hybrid role that blends the visionary leadership of an agency Art Director with the workflow management of a Traffic Manager. You will oversee the creative development of brand assets from concept to delivery, while also ensuring efficient project prioritization, resourcing (both internal & external), and traffic flow across the team.

This role is perfect for a strategic, design-savvy leader who can bring big-picture creative thinking while driving operational excellence within a fast-paced, high-volume environment.

What can you expect to be accountable for in this role?

Creative Direction & Design Oversight

Facilitate and lead collaborative concepting sessions that bring together multi-disciplinary teams across mixed media (digital, video, experiential) and traditional channels (print/collateral) to develop bold, integrated creative ideas.
Lead visual development and design execution across all marketing, brand, and communications touchpoints.
Provide clear creative direction, feedback, and mentorship to designers and freelance partners.
Ensure all creative aligns with brand standards, business objectives, and stakeholder expectations.
Studio & Workflow Management

Own the intake, prioritization, resourcing, and traffic management of all creative requests.
Develop and manage studio processes, timelines, and workflows to ensure projects move efficiently from briefing to delivery.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams (Marketing, Product, Sales, etc.) to balance creative capacity with organizational needs.
Team Leadership & Collaboration

Manage and inspire a team of in-house designers and external creative partners.
Act as the liaison between the creative team and internal clients to ensure clarity, alignment, and timely delivery.
Lead multi-discipline teams through brainstorms, design reviews, and feedback loops to elevate creative thinking and ensure team alignment.
Proactively identify bottlenecks and opportunities to improve creative processes and outputs.
Quality Control & Brand Stewardship

Maintain high standards for creative quality, consistency, and brand integrity.
Review and approve final deliverables to ensure accuracy and alignment with project goals.
What do you bring to the role?

6+ years of experience in a creative design leadership role, preferably in an agency or in-house studio environment.
Proven ability to balance creative excellence with operational efficiency.
Strong portfolio demonstrating creative leadership across digital, print, social, and experiential platforms.
Experience leading multi-disciplinary teams through integrated concept development across mixed media and traditional channels.
Deep understanding of project management principles, resource planning, and traffic workflows.
Exceptional organizational, communication, and stakeholder management skills.
Ability to inspire and motivate creative teams in a collaborative environment.
Proficiency in project management tools (Asana) and design tools (e.g. Adobe Creative Suite, Figma). 
Salary Range: $77,100 - $142,000
