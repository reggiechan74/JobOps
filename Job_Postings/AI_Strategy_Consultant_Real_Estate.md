## Why This Role Matters

Real estate is a $300+ trillion global industry undergoing massive technological disruption. AI/ML tools promise to transform property operations, investment decision-making, and customer experiences. However, most real estate professionals lack the technical literacy to separate signal from noise, while most AI experts lack real estate domain knowledge to identify truly valuable applications.

You'll be the rare professional who bridges both worlds - helping traditional real estate companies navigate AI adoption while keeping AI vendors honest about what's actually achievable. Your work will directly impact how billions of square feet of property is managed and how trillions of dollars in capital is allocated.

## Application Process

Submit:
1. Resume highlighting real estate experience and AI literacy
2. Cover letter addressing: "Describe an AI use case you've identified in real estate and how you would implement it"
3. Writing sample: Strategy document, whitepaper, or executive presentation (optional but strongly preferred)

We value diverse perspectives and real estate experience across all property types (office, industrial, retail, multifamily, infrastructure, land) and functions (asset management, leasing, development, finance, operations).
