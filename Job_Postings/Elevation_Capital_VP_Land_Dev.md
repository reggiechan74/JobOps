WHAT YOU’LL DO

As VP of Land Development, you will lead end-to-end execution of a multi-phase global real estate vision focused on creating resilient, high-design retreats in remote and coastal environments - including ongoing projects in the Bahamas, Canada, and a small off-grid ranch in Arizona. Working closely with the Founder, you will build and lead the project execution function — managing site-level construction, hiring and developing a high-performance PM team, and coordinating design, permitting, infrastructure, and buildout across diverse sites.

You will work closely with UHNWI stakeholders, aligning development execution with their elevated expectations and lifestyle-driven investment goals. You’ll thrive in a high-urgency, design-build environment where expectations exceed industry norms and deadlines often seem impossible — because speed is the mandate, not the exception.

You’ll move fluidly between strategy and execution — translating vision into concrete scope, sequencing activity across locations, enforcing timelines and budgets, and holding vendors and internal stakeholders accountable to world-class standards. Sites range from off-grid builds with helicopter-only access, to technology-enabled modular homes, to complex luxury developments across multiple countries requiring local labor and regulatory navigation.

WHO YOU ARE

Pace-Driven Executor – Energized by timelines that feel impossible to others. Excels in environments where speed is a competitive advantage and project velocity is non-negotiable.
Hands-on Builder – Brings a strong foundation in field construction or GC operations. Understands the real-world mechanics of getting things built in tough environments.
Execution-Focused Leader – Thrives in pushing high-velocity projects forward. Knows how to prioritize, plan, and align teams for consistent progress.
Systems Thinker – Brings clarity to chaos. Designs playbooks, processes, and frameworks that allow complex projects to run smoothly.
Accountable Operator – Holds contractors, consultants, and team members to deadlines, budgets, and execution standards. Doesn’t accept excuses.
Strategic Translator – Works directly with the founder and executive team to interpret vision, define scope, and turn abstract ideas into tangible project phases.
Field + Finance Communicator – Moves easily between site-level coordination and board-level reporting. Keeps leadership informed and problems surfaced early.
Luxury Client-Caliber Professional – Comfortable working directly with ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI), adapting to their elevated expectations, discretion standards, and sophisticated design and investment preferences.
Design-Build Mindset – Understands how to lead both the design and build sides of a project. Seamlessly integrates vision, aesthetics, and construction feasibility into every phase of development.

RESPONSIBILITIES

Lead full-cycle execution of multiple design-build development projects, including off-grid, modular, and coastal luxury sites across international jurisdictions
Coordinate complex development efforts in the Bahamas, Canada, and Arizona, including remote utility, tech-forward systems, and jurisdiction-specific permitting
Build and manage a team of project managers and coordinators, assigning projects based on specialization and location
Directly oversee project phases from scope and design coordination through permitting, infrastructure, vertical construction, and closeout
Coordinate infrastructure development including power systems, marine access, water/septic, and site-level utilities
Drive budget discipline — tracking costs, evaluating vendor contracts, and adjusting scope as needed to preserve value
Implement project controls, reporting systems, and execution workflows to ensure schedule visibility and issue escalation
Serve as the senior development liaison to architects, engineers, consultants, and permitting authorities across multiple jurisdictions
Interface directly with ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI), translating vision into execution while managing expectations, timelines, and discretion with the highest level of professionalism
Drive execution under accelerated timelines, navigating challenges and compressing delivery schedules to meet ambitious project milestones
Proactively identify risks, remove blockers, and solve operational challenges to maintain momentum across all sites
Travel required internationally (up to 50%) to job sites in various locations which include but are not limited to Vancouver, BC, Caribbean, and the United States.

WHAT YOU’LL BRING

7–10+ years of experience in construction or real estate development, with a background in field operations, PM leadership, and infrastructure-heavy sites
Experience managing active job sites with complex logistical, permitting, or utility challenges — such as off-grid or remote access builds
Proven ability to oversee multiple concurrent projects with different scopes, contractors, and stakeholder groups
Proven track record leading capital projects from design through build, with full ownership of scope, schedule, and execution.
Track record of leading both internal teams and external trades with accountability, urgency, and clarity
Demonstrated ability to bring order to unstructured or high-growth environments — building systems that scale while keeping execution tight
Strong written and verbal communication skills to keep the founder and executive team informed through structured, data-backed reporting
Familiarity with collaborative PM tools (Smartsheet, Google Sheets, etc.) and a willingness to implement software systems that improve team performance
