# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a resume optimization system that uses a three-step methodology to create tailored, credible resumes from master career inventory documents. The system employs the HAM-Z methodology (Hard Skill, Action, Metrics, Structure combined with XYZ narrative structure) and includes provenance hardening to ensure all claims are defensible.

## Key Directories

- **ResumeSourceFolder/**: Contains master resume documents (comprehensive career inventory)
  - `Comprehensive_CV_MASTER_COPY_v35.md`: Primary master resume with complete work history
  - `Comprehensive_CV_Technology_Capability.md`: Technical skills and capabilities inventory

- **SourceMaterial/**: Contains methodology documentation
  - `CV_Master_Resume_Guide_v3.md`: Complete HAM-Z methodology guide
  - `CV_Provenance_Hardening_Pass_Check_Prompt.md`: Provenance analysis framework

- **Scoring_Rubrics/**: Contains assessment rubrics and scoring frameworks
  - Dynamic rubrics: Job-specific rubrics created by `/assessjob` or `/createrubric` commands with embedded detailed scoring framework
  - Reusable rubrics: Created by `/createrubric` for consistent evaluation across multiple candidates
  - Format: `Rubric_[Company]_[Role]_[Date].md` for each assessment

- **OutputResumes/**: Generated resume drafts and analysis outputs
  - Step 1 drafts: Initial targeted resumes
  - Step 2 analyses: Provenance check reports
  - Step 3 finals: Hardened, interview-ready resumes

- **Job_Postings/**: Target job descriptions in markdown format
  - Store job postings as `.md` files for processing
  - Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `CompanyName_Role_Date.md`)
  - Search results automatically saved as `SearchResults_[Query]_[Date].md` with complete job descriptions

- **Briefing_Notes/**: Interview preparation and skill gap study guides
  - Gap analysis briefings: Focus on addressing identified weaknesses
  - Full preparation briefings: Comprehensive interview readiness guides
  - Interview question sets: Customized questions with answer strategies
  - Format: `Briefing_[Company]_[Role]_[Mode]_[Date].md` and `Interview_Prep_[Company]_[Role]_[Date].md`

## Working with Resume Files

When processing resumes:
1. Always read from `ResumeSourceFolder/` for master data
2. Job descriptions should be stored in `Job_Postings/` directory as `.md` files
3. Legacy job descriptions may exist in root directory (e.g., `AltoJobPost.md`)
4. Output resumes should be saved to `OutputResumes/` with descriptive timestamps
5. Use the HAM-Z formula: **Achieved [Metric-Driven Result] by leveraging [Hard Skill] to [perform specific action/process]**

## File Organization Best Practices

- **Job Postings**: Use format `Job_Postings/CompanyName_Role_Date.md`
- **Output Files**: Automatically named with step, role, company, and date
- **Master Resume**: Keep only verified, defensible content in source documents
- **Evidence Trail**: Maintain clear provenance from master to final resume

## Provenance Analysis Categories

High Risk issues to flag:
- Unbounded metrics without timeframes
- Unsupported superlatives ("market-leading", "transformational")
- Cross-document inconsistencies
- Benchmark claims without defined peer sets

Medium Risk issues:
- Mechanism-free outcomes (results without "how")
- Duplicate achievements across roles
- Tool names without measurable outcomes

## Cultural Profiles

The system supports different cultural profiles for resume tailoring. When not specified, defaults to Canadian style which emphasizes:
- Quantified achievements
- Clear role boundaries
- Specific technologies and methodologies
- Conservative language without superlatives

## Important Commands and Tools

### Assessment Workflow Options

#### Option 1: Complete Assessment (Traditional)
```bash
/assessjob JobPosting.md  # Creates rubric + performs assessment
```

#### Option 2: Modular Assessment (Recommended for Multiple Candidates)
```bash
/createrubric JobPosting.md  # Create reusable rubric once
/assesscandidate Rubric_Company_Role_Date.md JobPosting.md  # Assess each candidate
```

### Development Commands
- No build/compile commands needed (markdown-based system)
- No test framework (validation through provenance analysis)
- Git for version control: `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`
- Pandoc for document conversion: `pandoc --version` to verify installation

### Key Validation Steps
When creating or modifying resumes:
1. Run provenance check after any draft creation
2. Verify all metrics have timeframes and mechanisms
3. Ensure cultural profile alignment
4. Check for duplicate achievements across roles

## System Architecture

The resume optimization system follows a comprehensive 8-step pipeline architecture:

### Phase 1: Resume Development (Steps 1-3)
1. **Input Layer**: Job postings + Master resume data
2. **Processing Layer**: HAM-Z methodology transformation with cultural profile adaptation
3. **Validation Layer**: Provenance hardening and credibility assessment
4. **Output Layer**: Final, defensible resume ready for submission

### Phase 2: Interview Preparation (Steps 4-6)
5. **Assessment Layer**: HR-level candidate evaluation with scoring rubrics
6. **Learning Layer**: Gap analysis and skill development planning
7. **Practice Layer**: Customized interview question generation with strategic guidance

### Phase 3: Application Finalization (Steps 7-8)
8. **Communication Layer**: Strategic cover letter with requirements matching
9. **Presentation Layer**: Professional document conversion for submission

Each step in the pipeline has dedicated agents that maintain consistency and quality throughout the complete application process, from initial resume creation to final interview preparation.
