            <h2>What It Does</h2>
            <p>You just scored 73/100 on a job assessment. Should you apply? This command tells you exactly what you're missing, how long it would take to credibly fill those gaps, and whether you should walk away instead. No more wasting 40 hours prepping for a role you'll never get.</p>
            <p>Some gaps are dealbreakers. Some are easy wins. The difference between wasting time on a hopeless application and investing in a winnable one is knowing which gaps matter — and whether they're closeable in your timeline.</p>
