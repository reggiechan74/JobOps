## Hiring Recommendation
☐ Strongly Recommend - Exceptional fit
☐ Recommend - Strong candidate with minor gaps
☐ Consider - Meets requirements with development needs
☒ Not Recommended - Significant gaps

### Justification
While Reggie Chan demonstrates exceptional real estate expertise, sophisticated deal management capabilities, and outstanding professional credentials, he lacks the fundamental B2B sales experience required for this role. The position requires a proven hunter who can consistently prospect, generate leads, and close 8+ partnership deals annually. Reggie's background as an institutional consultant and asset manager, while highly valuable, does not translate to the quota-carrying, performance-driven sales environment at IWG.

**Key Disqualifying Factors:**
1. **Zero demonstrated B2B sales experience** in 20+ year career
2. **No evidence of quota achievement** or performance-based compensation success
3. **Missing hunter mentality** - career focused on managing existing relationships
4. **No virtual sales presentation capability** demonstrated
5. **Cultural misalignment** with competitive, results-driven sales environment

**Alternative Role Consideration:**
Reggie would be exceptionally qualified for senior real estate advisory, asset management, or consulting roles within IWG's development team, where his expertise could support sales efforts without requiring direct quota responsibility.

## Next Steps
1. **Do Not Advance** to interview for Sales Director role based on fundamental skill gaps
2. **Consider for Alternative Roles**: Explore fit for Senior Real Estate Advisor, Development Consultant, or Asset Management positions
3. **Network Referral**: Leverage Reggie's extensive real estate network for potential landlord introductions and market intelligence
4. **Future Opportunity**: Monitor for senior advisory or consulting roles where real estate expertise is primary requirement
