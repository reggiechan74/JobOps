☐ **80-89**: Excellent candidate - strong match, minor gaps if any
☐ **70-79**: Good candidate - solid match, some development areas

☐ **50-59**: Borderline candidate - significant gaps, consider if high potential
☑ **Below 50**: Not recommended - major gaps in critical areas

### Justification
While Reggie Chan demonstrates exceptional capabilities in real estate and infrastructure management, he lacks the fundamental construction, development, and field operations experience essential for success in this VP Land Development role. The position requires hands-on construction leadership, design-build project management, and direct development experience that are not present in his background.

**Critical Missing Elements:**
- No field construction or GC operations experience
- Limited development project portfolio (single condo conversion)
- No off-grid, remote, or luxury development experience
- Absence of construction team leadership
- No direct UHNWI client management in development context

**Alternative Consideration:**
If Elevation Capital values his infrastructure expertise and analytical capabilities, he might be better suited for a property acquisition, asset management, or strategic development role rather than operational development leadership.

## Next Steps
**For Hiring Team:**
1. **Seek Construction-Focused Candidates**: Prioritize candidates with 7-10+ years hands-on development and construction experience
2. **Consider Alternative Roles**: Reggie may be excellent fit for asset management, acquisition, or strategic planning roles within real estate portfolio
3. **Market Expansion**: Broaden search to include candidates from luxury hospitality development, resort construction, and off-grid specialists
4. **Compensation Adjustment**: Budget $250K-$400K+ for qualified candidates with required construction development experience

**Assessment Framework Validation:**
The scoring rubric effectively identified critical gaps while recognizing transferable strengths, confirming the need for construction-specific experience in this role.
