- No AI buzzwords like "AI-powered," "revolutionary," "cutting-edge," or "transform"

### SECTION 4: THE PROBLEM

**Background:** Charcoal (`#1b263b`)

**Eyebrow:**
```
THE OPERATING CONSTRAINT
```

**Headline:**
```
Portfolio Growth Creates Operational Drag
```

**Lead Paragraph:**
```
Commercial real estate teams lose thousands of hours annually to manual
processes. The technology exists to automate most of this work—but generic
tools don't understand lease economics, and implementation teams lack
domain expertise.
```
*Style: 18px, off-white, max-width 800px*

**Problem Grid (2x2 or 1x4 layout):**

| Icon | Problem |
|------|---------|
| Clock/Time | **60% Administrative Burden** — Investment professionals spending majority of time on data reconciliation and administrative tasks instead of deal sourcing. |
| Speed/Arrow | **Accelerating Deal Velocity** — Transaction timelines compressing from weeks to days while operational infrastructure remains unchanged. |
| Chart/Down | **Underperforming Technology** — Significant enterprise system investments delivering minimal ROI when implementation teams lack real estate domain expertise. |
| Gap/Distance | **Widening Competitive Gap** — Institutional peers with optimized workflows identifying opportunities 3-4 weeks earlier, compounding advantage over time. |

*Card Style: Slate background, 32px padding, subtle icon in gold or muted teal*

**Stakes Statement (Below Grid):**
```
The cost isn't just inefficiency—it's opportunities lost to competitors
with better operational infrastructure.
```
*Style: 16px, italic, muted gray, centered*

### SECTION 5: THE SOLUTION / WHY TENEBRUS

**Background:** Deep Navy (`#0d1b2a`)

**Eyebrow:**
```
THE TENEBRUS APPROACH
```

**Headline:**
```
Domain Expertise Meets Technical Execution
```

**Lead Paragraph:**
```
Tenebrus Capital bridges the gap between technology consultants who don't
understand real estate, and real estate advisors who can't implement systems.
This rare combination enables operational optimization grounded in firsthand
portfolio management experience.
```

**Differentiator Grid (3 columns):**

**Column 1:**
```
THE RARE COMBINATION

Fewer than 100 professionals globally
hold FRICS and CFA designations
alongside AI/ML implementation
capabilities.

This enables us to speak both
languages—investment professionals
and technologists understand our
recommendations immediately.
```

**Column 2:**
```
PRINCIPAL-LED DELIVERY

Unlike Big 4 engagements that deploy
junior consultants learning your
business on your budget, Tenebrus
is principal-led.

Every assessment, recommendation,
and implementation decision comes
from 24 years of direct institutional
portfolio management experience.
```

**Column 3:**
```
PRODUCTION-GRADE SYSTEMS

Generic AI tools hallucinate financial
calculations. Our systems have 235+
automated tests validating every
calculation, with 100% accuracy
against Excel baselines.

No experimental technology—only
proven, auditable systems with
complete traceability.
```

*Style: Each column in a subtle card or separated by vertical lines*
