<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/JobOps_logo.png" alt="JobOps Logo" width="400">
</p>

**Wage war on unemployment.** A tactical job application platform that transforms career inventories into winning applications through systematic opportunity assessment, credible resume development, and strategic interview preparation using an 8-step intelligence-driven methodology.

## Rapid Deployment Protocol

1. Install dependencies: `npm run install-all`
2. Populate `ResumeSourceFolder/` with your master resume inventory and add target roles to `Job_Postings/`
3. Start the Playwright MCP server (see "Run the Playwright MCP server" in `SETUP.md`) so Claude Code can reach browser automation
4. Launch Claude Code in this repository and run slash commands such as `/assessjob Job_Postings/Example.md` followed by `/buildresume`

## Architecture Overview

- **Claude Code CLI** orchestrates the workflow: users issue slash commands that call specialized agents under `.claude/`
- **Playwright MCP server** provides headless browser automation for job sourcing and intelligence gathering
- **Content directories** (`ResumeSourceFolder/`, `Job_Postings/`, `OutputResumes/`, `Briefing_Notes/`) hold source materials, generated analyses, and deliverables
- **HAM-Z agents** execute each step: resume drafting, provenance hardening, and interview preparation
- **Scoring and OSINT resources** in `Scoring_Rubrics/` and `Intelligence_Reports/` feed assessments and research deliverables

## Tactical Capabilities

JobOps deploys the HAM-Z™ methodology to create powerful, defensible strike packages that are:
- **Strategically positioned** for specific roles
- **Culturally attuned** to regional preferences
- **Provenance-hardened** to withstand scrutiny
- **ATS-optimized** for applicant tracking systems

Deploy a tactical 8-step offensive organized into three phases: strike package assembly (Steps 1-3), interview preparation (Steps 4-6), and mission execution (Steps 7-8), ensuring every claim is verified and every achievement is weaponized with mechanism, metrics, and timeframe.

### Theoretical Foundation: Assessment-First Hiring

This application was designed around the **Assessment-First Hiring Model**, a system dynamics approach that addresses the fundamental inefficiency in modern job markets. The theoretical framework, detailed in [`SourceMaterial/System_Dynamics_Analysis_Assessment_First_Hiring_v3.md`](SourceMaterial/System_Dynamics_Analysis_Assessment_First_Hiring_v3.md), demonstrates how AI-assisted resume embellishment has created a "Vicious Cycle of Embellishment" where:

- 73.4% of job seekers use AI tools to enhance resumes
- Signal-to-noise ratio has degraded to **-2.5 dB** (more noise than signal)
- Employers add screening layers, incentivizing further embellishment

The assessment-first model breaks this cycle by evaluating candidate fit *before* application creation, potentially achieving:
- **35-60% reduction** in misaligned applications
- **30-60% decrease** in time-to-hire
- **40-80% improvement** in overall market matching efficiency
- **+3.2 to +10.4 dB improvement** in signal quality

This theoretical foundation explains why JobOps begins with target reconnaissance (`/assessjob`) rather than immediate resume creation - preventing wasted effort on fundamentally poor targets while ensuring only high-probability opportunities receive full tactical deployment.

## Weapons Systems

- **HAM-Z™ Methodology**: Combines Hard Skills, Actions, Metrics, and Structure with XYZ narrative format to create precision-targeted achievements
- **Provenance Hardening**: Comprehensive credibility verification to identify and eliminate fabricated claims
- **Cultural Profiles**: Adapts resume style to regional theater expectations (Canadian, US, European, etc.)
- **Arsenal Inventory**: Maintains comprehensive career database separate from mission-specific deployments
- **Dynamic Target Scoring**: Creates custom reconnaissance rubrics for each opportunity
- **Interview Preparation**: Gap analysis intelligence briefings and tactical rehearsal question generation
- **Distributed OSINT Intelligence**: Professional-grade company reconnaissance with parallel specialized agents
- **Target Acquisition System**: Hybrid search combining API reconnaissance + Playwright deep-scan for complete intelligence

## Tactical Operations Workflow

### 1. Build Your Arsenal Inventory

**The Core Problem**: Traditional 2-page resumes create a critical shortage when deploying AI for tailoring. When you attempt to customize condensed resumes, AI tools must fabricate plausible-sounding but fictional claims, leading to failures under interview scrutiny.

**The Solution**: A comprehensive 20+ page arsenal inventory serves as your "full career database" - every achievement, metric, and skill is documented with complete context. This allows AI to **deploy** verified content rather than **fabricate** it.

**📖 Essential Reading**: Start with [`Master_Resume_Comprehensive_Setup_Guide_v1.md`](Master_Resume_Comprehensive_Setup_Guide_v1.md) for complete methodology and [`comprehensive_work_history_FAQ.md`](comprehensive_work_history_FAQ.md) for quick conceptual explanation.

Place your comprehensive career inventory in `ResumeSourceFolder/`:
- Complete work history with all projects and achievements using HAMZ-Extended framework
- Technology capabilities and skills inventory with proficiency assessments
- Awards, publications, and certifications with full context and validation

**Critical Standard**: Every claim must withstand interview interrogation with verified examples, metrics, and mechanisms documented.

### 2. Acquire Target Coordinates

**Option A: Deploy target acquisition sweep**
```bash
/searchjobs "your search query" "location" --save
```
Conducts reconnaissance sweep of hiring.cafe and automatically extracts complete verbatim target intelligence to `Job_Postings/` folder.

**Option B: Manual target upload**
Create a markdown file in `Job_Postings/` directory (e.g., `Job_Postings/CompanyName_Role_Date.md`)

### 3. Conduct Target Reconnaissance

Before committing strike resources, conduct reconnaissance on target viability:

```bash
/assessjob Job_Postings/AltoJobPost.md
```

Generates comprehensive reconnaissance report showing engagement probability and identifies critical capability gaps. **Only deploy full strike package if reconnaissance shows viable engagement** (typically 60%+ hit probability).

### 4. Assemble Strike Package (If Reconnaissance is Positive)

```bash
/buildresume Job_Postings/AltoJobPost.md Canadian
```

Executes the core 3-step resume assembly: initial draft creation, provenance verification, final hardened resume.

### 5. Prioritize Multiple Targets (If Applicable)

```bash
/comparejobs Assessment_Company1_Role1_Date.md Assessment_Company2_Role2_Date.md
```

### 6. Conduct Interview Preparation

**Generate intelligence brief to address capability gaps:**
```bash
/briefing OutputResumes/Assessment_[Company]_[Role]_[Date].md Job_Postings/AltoJobPost.md gaps-only
```

**Deploy interview prep questions:**
```bash
/interviewprep OutputResumes/Step3_Final_Resume_[Role]_[Company]_[Date].md Job_Postings/AltoJobPost.md
```

### 7. Execute Final Mission Sequence (Optional)

**Deploy strategic cover letter:**
```bash
/coverletter OutputResumes/Step3_Final_Resume_[Role]_[Company]_[Date].md Job_Postings/AltoJobPost.md
```

**Convert to deployment-ready format:**
```bash
/install-pandoc    # Install pandoc if needed
/convert all       # Convert all documents to Word format
```

## Command Arsenal

### Target Reconnaissance
```bash
/assessjob <job-description-file>
```
**START HERE** - Deploys dynamic reconnaissance rubric and 100-point viability assessment with engage/disengage recommendation.

### Resume Assembly
```bash
/buildresume <job-description-file> [cultural-profile]
```
Executes full 3-step assembly protocol (draft creation, provenance verification, hardened final resume). Theater profiles: Canadian (default), US, European, UK, Australian.

### Modular Reconnaissance Workflow
```bash
/createrubric <job-posting-file>                              # Establish reusable targeting criteria
/assesscandidate <rubric-file> <job-posting-file>            # Execute standardized reconnaissance
/comparejobs <assessment-1> <assessment-2> [assessment-3]    # Prioritize multiple targets
```

### Interview Preparation
```bash
/briefing <assessment-report> <job-description> [gaps-only]  # Generate intelligence brief
/interviewprep <resume-file> <job-description> [N]           # Deploy interview prep questions
```

### Target Acquisition System
```bash
/searchjobs <query> [location] [--company=name] [--save] [--limit=N]
```
Two-phase hybrid reconnaissance: API sweep + Playwright deep-scan for complete verbatim target intelligence. Default 20 targets, max 50 recommended.

**Examples:**
```bash
/searchjobs "software engineer" "Toronto"
/searchjobs "data analyst" --company=Deloitte --save
/searchjobs "python developer" "Mississauga" --save --limit=30
```

### Intelligence Operations
```bash
/osint <company-name>
```
Deploys 6 specialized intelligence agents in parallel for comprehensive target analysis: Corporate, Legal, Leadership, Compensation, Culture, Market.

### Mission Support
```bash
/provenance <draft-resume-file>                              # Provenance verification sweep
/coverletter <step3-resume> <job-description> [manager]      # Deploy cover letter
/convert <file-path-or-pattern> [output-directory]          # Convert to deployment format
/install-pandoc [force]                                      # Install conversion utility
```

## Provenance Risk Categories

### Critical Risk (Mission Abort)
- Fabricated capabilities, skills, or experience not documented in arsenal inventory
- Language skills without explicit documentation
- Industry or geographic experience without supporting evidence

### High Risk (Must Fix)
- Unbounded metrics without timeframes
- Unsupported superlatives ("market-leading", "transformational")
- Cross-document inconsistencies
- Benchmark claims without defined peer sets

### Medium Risk (Should Fix)
- Results without mechanism ("how")
- Duplicate achievements across roles
- Tools listed without outcomes

### Low Risk (Consider Fixing)
- Ambiguous scope or geography
- Confidentiality concerns
- Minor formatting inconsistencies
